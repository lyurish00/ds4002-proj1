Martin Luther King Jr. and his own inauguration three years ago by touting that theunemployment ratefor African-Americans is the lowest in history. â€œIt was exactly three years ago today, January 20, 2017, that I was sworn into office,â€ Trump tweeted. â€œSo appropriate that today is also MLK jr DAY. Thetweetcontinued: â€œAfrican-American Unemployment is the LOWEST in the history of our Country, by far. Also, best Poverty, Youth, and Employment numbers, ever. Great!â€ Later in the day, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence made a short visit to the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial in Washington, D.C., to pay their respects. Trump was just one of many politicians – from all political stripes – to send out a message commemorating the civil rights leader. In an early tribute to King, Pence spoke Sunday in Memphis, Tennessee, at a church service in which he recalled the challenges and accomplishments of the slain civil rights leader. Before the service, Pence toured the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where King was shot and killed on April 4, 1968, while standing on a balcony. â€œI'm here to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who from walking the dirt roads of the Deep South, to speaking to hundreds of thousands on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, touched the hearts of the American people and led the civil rights movement to triumph over Jim Crow,â€ Pence said Sunday at the Holy City Church of God in Christ.

He saw what others could not see. He heard what others did not hear. He felt what others did not feel. Therefore, he did what others were not willing to do. King understoodanyform of racism defies the dignity of human life. That is why, in the midst of racial injustice and division in America, he dreamed about a day in our nation whenâ€œjustice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.â€His quote of Amos 5:24 mirrored the heart of a prophet who in his own day was witness to injustice and inequality. But King's interpretation of the text was tinged with a sense of holy dissatisfaction. Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he framed it this way:â€œNo, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.â€ Most of us remember MLK's 1963 speech by its most famous theme — â€œI Have a Dreamâ€ — but King was much more than a dreamer. What made him one of the most consequential figures of the 20th century was his insatiable desire for biblical justice. This desire would end up costing him his life, but his dream of biblical justice in America would live on. It still lives on today. Reflecting upon this history, I'm moved to humility and repentance. We are not black churches. We are not white churches. We are not Latino churches. We are not Asian churches. We are the church of Jesus Christ. We are members of the same body. In the true church of Jesus Christ, the walls of racism and injustice come down. When I look upon today, there are moments when I think we have come so far. But then, there are other moments that happen far too many times, when the evil of the human heart reminds me that we still have so far to go. It's with deep regret that I can do nothing to wipe clean the stained past against our African American brothers and sisters. But with all I am, I can join them in creating a future together that binds up the nation's wounds and always marches ahead knowing we will not be satisfied untilâ€œjustice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.â€ We cannot change the future of America by ourselves or by remaining cloistered with those who look, talk and think like us. Biblical justice demands engagement. This goes especially to the church in America. Silence is not the answer to our racial issues in America, and, to be perfectly frank, blind hope that our conflicts will sort out by themselves is a strategy to fail. Pastors and churches cannot sit passively on the sideline. This is one moment when the church of Jesus Christ must lead by exemplifying a strong commitment to racial unity. We are not black churches. We are not white churches. We are not Latino churches. We are not Asian churches. We are the church of Jesus Christ. We are members of the same body. In the true church of Jesus Christ, the walls of racism and injustice come down. On Martin Luther King Day, Jan. 15, I will join pastor Arthur L. Hunt, Jr. and Governor Asa Hutchinson at the Arkansas State Capitol and, along hundreds of pastors in Arkansas, we are going to stand and be united publicly. We are choosing unity, not simply talking about it. Our goal is not political or even racial, but biblical. We must not, we cannot, be satisfied until, as Amos said,â€œjustice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.â€ It's past time for racial unity in America. We've decided to be united.",0.25,0.75,0.0,-0.3252,0.096,0.764,0.14,0.9827

Latino Majority Texas City Puts On One Of The Country's Largest MLK Day Celebrations,"Martin Luther King Day march in San Antonio, Texas(sanantonio.gov) (sanantonio.gov) One of the largest celebrations in this nation for Martin Luther King Day takes place in a city that has a small African American community, and a Latino majority. San Antonio, Texas, where Latinos make up 63 percent of the city's 1.4 million residents, and blacks 7 percent and whites 26.6 percent, has been celebrating the late civil rights leader's birthday since 1987 and attracting one of the biggest crowds anywhere in the United States. The annual march attracts some 100,000 people, according to city figures. Last year the crowd was 150,000, say organizers. Large crowds also attend the various other activities around the city that focus on King's life and legacy. â€œThe fact that our city hosts one of the largest Martin Luther King Jr., marches in the nation reflects why San Antonio is a city on the rise,â€ said San Antonio Mayor JuliÃ¡n Castro in a written statement. â€œPeople of all backgrounds throughout history have found a place in San Antonio's diverse cultural communities.â€ Some published accounts say San Antonio began observing King's life and contributions to racial justice with a modest annual procession begun by a pastor who had pushed for a statue of the civil rights leader. In 1986, under the mayoralty of Henry Cisneros, city officials passed a resolution establishing the San Antonio Martin Luther King Jr. Commission, which paved the way for the annual celebration. Community activist Aaronetta Pierce and the late Rev. Claude Black, known in San Antonio for his civil rights work, were forces behind the city's full embrace of celebrating and promoting King's struggle for equality. Bishop David M. Copeland, the chair of the San Antonio Martin Luther King Commission, told Fox News Latino that the annual celebration has grown steadily in size and its mission. While published reports commonly describe San Antonio's march as one of the largest for Martin Luther King's birthday in the United States, Copeland asserts that it is ""the largest."" Work on Martin Luther King Day-related events begins a full seven months before, and involves about a dozen committees. The weeks leading up to the march, which this year is Jan. 20, include seminars, musical performances, art workshops and oratorical contests for school children. Some of the speakers and performers this year, when the theme is â€œRealizing The Dream: Jobs, Justice and Freedom,â€ include economist Julianne Malveaux, music star Sean Paul and AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka. The commission has expanded its focus to go beyond the January events, Copeland said. For example, for years it has given out about 20 scholarships, averaging about $1,000, to graduating high school seniors annually. In recent years, though, the scholarships have risen to about $2,000 each. The commission is hoping to raise more than $100,000, Copeland said, â€œso that we can give better scholarships,â€ noting that college is expensive. â€œWe want to promote education, to promote learning,â€ he said. â€œThat takes more than just marching two and a half miles every year.â€ Graciela Sanchez of the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center in San Antonio said that Latinos and African Americans in the city have often teamed up to address issues of concern to both communities. She noted that two Latinos are members of the city's Martin Luther King Commission. Elsewhere in the nation, many have noted the special influence that King continues to have on Latinos and their civil rights struggles. Donna Maria Blancero, an associate professor at Bentley University in Massachusetts, wrote last year: â€œDr. King inspired many Latinos, including Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta.â€ She noted that for the first time, last year, â€œa Latino, Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, [gave] the keynote address at Dr. King's commemorative service at King's own Ebenezer Baptist Church.â€ ""Latinos, just like other Americans, consider Dr. King a great leader of the civil rights movement,"" Blancero wrote. ""If he were alive today, he likely would be working side by side with Latinos to address issues of inequality.â€",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.007,0.897,0.096,0.9955

But with the November presidential election as a backdrop, some events took on an overtly political turn. In King's hometown of Atlanta, several speakers at the 56th annual commemorative service at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King served as pastor, touched on the divisive partisan climate in the United States. Former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, who served on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, had harsh words for Trump, whom she did not mention by name. On that day, Trump's supporters tried to block Congress from counting the Electoral College votes that would affirm Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential race. â€œA former president refuses to acknowledge that he lost, and he has convinced millions that our elections and our democracy no longer work,â€ she said. â€œHe threatens the foundations of our nation and everything Dr. King persevered to save.â€ She also criticized some religious leaders in the way they seemed to worship Trump, not God. U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, the longtime senior pastor of Ebenezer, told the audience, â€œYou better stand up and vote!â€ to rousing applause. â€œIf your vote didn't count, why are folks trying so hard to keep you from voting? Stand and use your voice. Stand up and use your vote. Speak up!â€ The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday has been marked with events, parades, acts of service and by some observers with an eye on the election. AP correspondent Norman Hall reports. Bernice King, the daughter of the late civil rights leader, warned that â€œour humanity is literally under attack.â€ But she noted that her father's legacy of nonviolence taught the world that â€œwe can defeat injustice, ignorance and hold people accountable at the same time without seeking to destroy, diminish, demean or cancel them.â€ Speaking at the MLK Day at the Dome rally at the South Carolina Statehouse, Vice President Kamala Harris said young people two or three generations removed from King have seen their freedoms shrink — from laws restricting voting to bans on abortions and the ever-present threat of gun violence, especially in schools.

Harris also used her speech at the event — which started in 2000 to pressure the state to remove the Confederate flag from atop the Capitol dome — to urge the younger generation to regain those rights lost through voting and action. â€œGeneration after generation on the fields of Gettysburg, in the schools of Little Rock, on the grounds of this Statehouse, on the streets of Ferguson and on the floor of the Tennessee House of Representatives — we the people have always fought to make the promise of freedom real,â€ Harris said. In Philadelphia, President Joe Biden marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day by volunteering at Philabundance, a nonprofit food bank. He stuffed donation boxes with apples and struck up casual chatter with workers at the organization, where he volunteered for the third time as president or president-elect to mark the January day of service.

Also in the city, the Philadelphia MLK Association held its annual tapping of the Liberty Bell on Independence Mall, and the National Constitution Center offered free admission with a slate of civil rights era events and a school supply drive. In Washington, Martin Luther King III participated in a wreath-laying event at his father's memorial. In Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers, at a noontime ceremony in the state Capitol rotunda, said the holiday is an opportunity to recommit to addressing health disparities, fully funding public schools and providing affordable housing, child care and transportation. Doing that â€œwe can build the sort of future we all want to see for our state,â€ the Democratic former educator said. In Los Angeles, thousands gathered for the annual Kingdom Day Parade, with the theme â€œCan't Stop, Won't Stop, Going to the Promised Land.â€ LA Mayor Karen Bass urged Angelenos to honor King's legacy by taking care of vulnerable communities, including the homeless. â€œThe inequality is staggering, with more than 70% of unhoused Angelenos being people of color. While we celebrate the legacy of Dr. King today, we must recommit to confronting this crisis of our time,â€ Bass said in a statement. Meanwhile,a dangerously cold winterstorm was limiting some planned activities. The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis announced that it would be closed on Monday because of icy roads but would still hold a virtual celebration in honor of King's birthday. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina border was also closed, canceling a campground cleanup event. Also canceled because of weather was the Martin Luther King Gymnastics Invitational set for Monday at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The historic meet was to include Fisk, Brown, Iowa State, Rutgers, Talladega (Ala.) and William & Mary. The competition aimed to feature the only African American women head coaches in the sport for the first time ever. Observed federally since 1986, the holiday occurs on the third Monday of January, which this year happens to be King's actual birthday. Born in 1929, the slain civil rights leader would have been 95. This year also marks the 60th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act and King's Nobel Peace Prize. Collins reported from Columbia, S.C.

Police said four people including a child sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the ensuing confusion, the station reported. â€œIt was mass chaos, as you can imagine, when shots rang out,â€ Hester said. â€œThere were a thousand plus people here at the event, and as the shots rang out, people were just running in all directions.â€ The sheriff's office said two deputies at the event responded immediately and aided victims, WPBF-TV reported. Video obtained by the station showed people ducking, running and hiding behind cars, including a woman running to safety while holding a baby. â€œIt's really sad in a celebration of someone who represented peace and equality that a disagreement results in a use of guns and violence to solve that disagreement, and that's what's really sad to me about what happened here,â€ Hester said. â€œAnd then so many innocent people who were injured or hurt and were not part of the disagreement as well.â€",0.223,0.777,0.0,-0.3182,0.149,0.781,0.07,-0.9713

Speaking in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Martin Luther King III said though he was marking the federal holiday named for his father, he wasn't there to celebrate. He was there to call on Congress and President Joe Biden to pass the sweeping legislation that would help ease Republican-led voting restrictions passed in at least 19 states that make it more difficult to cast a ballot. â€œOur democracy stands on the brink of serious trouble without these bills,â€ he said. Monday's holiday marked what would have been the 93rd birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was just 39 when he was assassinated in 1968 while helping sanitation workers strike for better pay and workplace safety in Memphis, Tennessee. Around the U.S., other holiday events included marches in several cities, acts of service in King's name, and the annual Martin Luther King Jr. service at the slain civil rights leader's Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock is the senior pastor. Pews have been packed by politicians in past years, but given the pandemic, many gave either pre-recorded or livestreamed remarks instead, including Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden said Americans must commit to the King's unfinished work, delivering jobs and justice and protecting â€œthe sacred right to vote, a right from which all other rights flow.â€ â€œIt's time for every elected official in America to make it clear where they stand,â€ Biden said. â€œIt's time for every American to stand up. Speak out, be heard. Where do you stand?â€ Democrats had hoped to vote on the legislation Monday, in a show of respect for the late civil rights leader as the issue gathered political steam late last year and peaked with apowerful blunt speech last week by Biden, who likened the Jan. 6, 2021, violence and election subversion of today with the civil rights struggles fought by King and others. But it comes too late for many civil rights leaders. Senate Republicans remain unified in opposition to the Democrats'voting bills, and the 50-50 chamber needs 60 votes to pass the legislation. Two Democrats, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, remain opposed to changing Senate rules that would allow for the Democrats to pass the bills without the GOP. The vote was pushed back to Tuesday, but it looks as if it there is no way through for the legislation to protect the right to vote. King told of how his father also faced a pushback on civil rights by those who believed the issue could not be solved with legislation. â€œThey told him he had to change hearts first. And he worked hard at that. After all, he was a Baptist preacher. But he knew that when someone is denying you your fundamental rights, conversation and optimism won't get you very far.â€ Sinema has argued that bipartisanship is needed to address the issue, but King countered that significant milestones, including the 14th Amendment that granted citizenship to former slaves, passed Congress without bipartisan support. Harris was meeting Monday with lawmakers ahead of the vote working to get the legislation passed. But when asked specifically about her message to Sinema and Manchin, she didn't engage directly. â€œAs I've said before, there are a hundred members of the United States Senate, and I'm not going to absolve — nor should any of us — absolve any member of the United States Senate from taking on a responsibility to follow through on the oath that they all took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,â€ she said. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate's only Black Republican, countered with a series of King Day-themed videos he said would emphasize positive developments on civil rights. Scott sidestepped criticism about GOP actions and accused Biden of labelling Republicans as racists. â€œTo compare or conflate people who oppose his positions as being racists and traitors to the country is not only insulting and infuriating, it's dead wrong,â€Scott told The Associated Press. To the sparse crowd at Ebenezer, Warnock, now running for reelection as Georgia's first Black senator, said that â€œeverybody loves Dr. King, they just don't always love what he represents.â€ â€œLet the word go forth, you cannot remember Dr. King and dismember his legacy at the same time,â€ Warnock said. â€œIf you will speak his name you have to stand up for voting rights, you have to stand up on behalf of the poor and the oppressed and the disenfranchised.â€ Other leaders weighed in, too. Former President Barack Obama shared a picture of King's granddaughter Yolanda admiring a bust of King that Obama kept in the Oval Office. â€œThe fight for voting rights takes perseverance,â€ Obama tweeted. â€œAs Dr. King said, 'There are no broad highways to lead us easily and inevitably to quick solutions. We must keep going.'â€ King â€œsaw a great injustice in his world and fought to right that wrong,â€ Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a recorded message played at Ebenezer. â€œHis methods ultimately led to success and showed all of us that taking the high road is the best path to achieving lasting change.â€ Democrat Stacey Abrams, now trying again to defeat Kemp as he seeks reelection, tweeted that King's call remains clear: â€œDeliver justice for the poor, protect those targeted by hate, defend the freedom to vote, and demand that our leaders fight current malice as the best bulwark against future harm.â€ King, who delivered his historic â€œI Have a Dreamâ€ speechwhile leading the1963 March on Washington and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, considered racial equality inseparable from alleviating poverty and stopping war. His insistence on nonviolent protest continues to influence activists pushing for civil rights and social change.

Biden and his wife, Jill, joined an assembly line in the parking lot of Philabundance, an organization that distributes food to people in need, and helped fill about 150 boxes with fresh fruit and nonperishables. As Biden and Harris took breaks from their inaugural preparations to honor the civil rights hero Monday, outgoing President Donald Trump remained out of public view at the White House for the sixth straight day. In past years, Trump has marked the holiday with unannounced visits to the King memorial in Washington, but no such outing was expected this year. Such a visit would have been complicated because Washington has become a fortress city of roadblocks and barricades before Wednesday's inauguration, as security officials work to avoid more violence following the Jan. 6 riot by a pro-Trump mob at the U.S. Capitol. In a measure of how nervous the capital city has become, U.S. Capitol Police on Monday briefly locked down the Capitol complex and paused inaugural rehearsals after fire broke out at a nearby homeless encampment. Biden transition officials, including incoming Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall and the deputy attorney general nominee, Lisa Monaco, held a videoconference with acting heads and career staff from national security agencies to discuss the security situation surrounding Inauguration Day. Harris played down any personal security concerns, saying she's â€œvery much looking forward to being sworn in.â€ â€œI will walk there, to that moment, proudly with my head up and my shoulders back,â€ Harris told reporters after volunteering at a food bank. Still, Washington residents were on high alert and much of the city felt desolate, with large swaths of the area around the Capitol, White House and National Mall sealed off from all but authorized personnel. Katie Henke, 40, a southwest D.C. resident, said the city felt on edge. She's concerned enough that she packed a â€œgo-bagâ€ with clothes and other personal items in case she feels she must flee her neighborhood. â€œThis is legitimately scary,â€ she said. â€œBetween the pandemic and Trump, I feel like our country is at a weak and vulnerable point. And we know there are forces inside and outside the country that see that vulnerability as an opportunity to do something.â€ Some 25,000 National Guard troops were being dispatched across the city to bolster security. Monuments — including the King memorial — are closed to the public until after Wednesday's inaugural events. Harris also resigned from her Senate seat Monday. She offered thanks to her California constituents in a farewell video posted on social media â€œfor the honor of representing the place of my birth, as a proud daughter of California.â€ First lady Melania Trump also posted a farewell video in which she thanked Americans for the â€œgreatest honor of my life,â€ but she made no mention of the incoming Biden administration. Her husband has already announced he will not attend the inauguration — he's the first outgoing president to skip the ceremony in 152 years — and will depart for Florida hours before Biden's swearing-in. And while Trump stayed out of view, the White House announced he had signed several executive orders, including an amended version of a previous order calling for the creation of â€œNational Garden of American Heroes.â€ Trump wants more figures to be honored in his proposed garden, including the late pop singer Whitney Houston, game show host Alex Trebek and Grover Cleveland, the only U.S. president to serve nonconsecutive terms, to a listthat already includedGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass and dozens more. Biden continued to build his administration. His transition team announced Monday he will nominate Rohit Chopra to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, tapping a liberal ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren to lead the agency whose creation she championed. Chopra, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, helped launch the agency after the 2008 financial crisis and served as deputy director, where he sounded the alarm about skyrocketing student loan debt. The pick comes as Democrats are eyeing ways to provide student loan relief to millions of Americans as part of a COVID-19 aid package. Biden also announced his intent to nominate Gary Gensler, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Inaugural organizers on Monday finished installing some 200,000 small U.S., state and territorial flags on the National Mall, a sobering display intended to honor the nearly 400,000 Americans killed in the coronavirus pandemic. Biden and Harris plan to take part in an event Tuesday, soon after the president-elect arrives in Washington, at the reflecting pool near the Lincoln Memorial to honor American lives lost to COVID-19. Even before the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, inauguration festivities were expected to be muted due to the virus. Mayor Muriel Bowser urged residents to stay away from the city on Inauguration Day. David Hill, general manager of the Phoenix Park Hotel near the Capitol working his seventh inauguration, said in a typical inauguration week the hotel would be booked solid months ahead, with guests looking to witness history willing to pay higher rates and stay a four-night minimum. Bookings only started to pick up in the last week or so — mostly journalists, National Guard troops and other security officials dispatched to D.C. amid the growing concerns about violence. Hill said he's now â€œclose to fullâ€ but guests aren't paying the typical inauguration premium. The German Federation of Journalists warned foreign correspondents covering the event to take precautions and be â€œparticularly careful and alert on Wednesdayâ€ after journalists were attacked during the riot at the Capitol. â€œIt is appalling that such an appeal is even necessary in the USA, once the model democracy,â€ said Frank Ueberall, the association's head. —- Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Colleen Long, Eric Tucker and Zeke Miller in Washington, Aamer Madhani in Chicago, and David Rising in Berlin contributed to this report.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.076,0.819,0.106,0.9785
MLK,AP,2020,Corey Williams,https://apnews.com/article/8f66f0de512566c227c143403900fe7f,US marks King holiday amid fears of deep racial divisions,"DETROIT (AP) — To commemorate the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Nicholas Thomas and more than 100 other volunteers will board up vacant houses, install school safety signs and make other improvements to a Detroit neighborhood. Their mission is to celebrate King's legacy by being good neighbors and helping lift up a primarily black school in one of the poorer areas of the city. As Thomas fans out across the neighborhood with hammer and nails, King's legacy of peace and racial and social justice will be foremost in his mind. But at the same time, he's struggling to come to grips with the deep racial divisions roiling the nation under President Donald Trump. â€œDr. King wanted unity. We have Trump separating immigrants ... the wall,â€ said the 19-year-old Thomas who is black. As the nation marks the holiday honoring King, the mood surrounding it is overshadowed by deteriorating race relations in an election season that has seen one candidate of color after another quit the 2020 presidential race. Two black candidates — U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker — and the lone candidate of Hispanic ancestry, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, havedropped outof the Democratic race for the White House. â€œThat scares me a lot,â€ said Deja Hood, 21, of Chicago, a senior at Eastern Michigan University. â€œWho is going to really back our voicing? You can't understand a minority if you've never been in a minority situation. Even though you can advocate for us all day, you could never understand the issues we go through on a daily basis.â€ Booker, Harris and Castro struggled with raising money and with polling. Asian American entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Samoan American, and black former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick remain in the race but are not considered top contenders for the Democratic nomination. The front-runners in the field are all white men and women. â€œIt's disappointing, but really not surprising. You look at it and think, 'damn, now what?'â€ said Xavier Cheatum, 22, an African American senior at Eastern Michigan who along with Hood is participating in King events on the school's Ypsilanti campus, west of Detroit. People have the right to be — and should be — concerned about the state of race relations and the way people of color, in particular, are being treated, said Jill Savitt, president of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. â€œWhat we're seeing right now, it's very public and people are showing their hatred openly, but it doesn't mean it wasn't there,â€ Savitt said. â€œThere is a coming realization in our country. We have to come to a reckoning about our past and the truth about our history from slavery to the lynching era to Jim Crow. Only with real honesty about our situation can we come to some reconciliation and move on to fulfill King's hope and dream of a real, peaceful multicultural democracy.â€ It doesn't help when elected leaders don't — or are slow to — stand against hate and intolerance, she added. Trump referred last year to a predominantly African American congressional district that includesBaltimoreas a â€œdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.â€ During a2018 immigration conversationin the Oval Office, he disparaged Haiti and some African countries with coarse language. And following a 2017 clash between white nationalist demonstrators and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump said there were â€œvery fine people on both sidesâ€ and that there was ""blame on both sides.â€ One anti-racism activist was killed. In 2018, there were more than 7,000 single-bias incidents reported by law enforcement, according toFBI hate crimestatistics. More than 53% of the offenders were white, while 24% were black. Nearly 60% of the incidents involved race, ethnicity and ancestry. â€œRacism has long been a way for people to maintain their power,â€ Savitt said. â€œManipulating people's fears and anxieties is the way you do that. The Trump administration has certainly fanned the flames.â€ Trump is trying to court black voters, knowing that he isn't likely to win them over en masse but could chip into Democratic advantages if he wins more black support in critical swing states. His campaign hasstepped up outreachefforts, including to African Americans and Latinos, marking a departure from 2016 when Trump's volunteer â€œNational Diversity Coalitionâ€ struggled to make an impact. The campaign already has spent more than $1 million on black outreach, including radio, print and online advertising in dozens of markets since the coalition's launch, the campaign has said. Only 6% of African American voters went for Trump in the 2016 election, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Trump's message to black voters in that campaign was: â€œWhat have you got to lose?â€ Supporters now say they have a record to point to, including the low black unemployment rate and investments in historically black colleges and universities. A Washington Post-Ipsospollof African Americans in early January found that 90% disapprove of Trump's job performance and 83% say Trump is racist. Laying it all in Trump's lap is unfair, said Carol Swain, an advisory board member to the national Black Voices for Trump. â€œWith Trump, he has pushed the American nationalist identity that I think tamps down the kind of conflicts we would have,â€ said Swain, who is black and has taught political science at Vanderbilt and Princeton universities. â€œHe has pushed patriotism over race and that benefits our country.â€ Faith Morris, chief marketing and external affairs officer for the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, doesn't see it that way. â€œIt's definitely a white America. A black America. A Hispanic America,â€ Morris said. â€œAnd there's a very broken line that connects the different Americas. In 2020, we still feel the oppressive issues that Dr. King fought against. He focused on the same things we're focusing on now.â€ Jacob Sklarsky recently read a book about King and the civil rights movement to students in his second-grade Chicago Public Schools class. â€œTo look at the faces of young black kids who are sometimes hearing about this history for the first time, they are distressed by it,â€ said Sklarsky, who is white and a member of KAM Isaiah Israel, a Jewish congregation in Chicago. â€œThey were very relieved at the end because, in a way, it was all worth it,â€ Sklarsky said. â€œIt gives us some hope, but it's also very sad that we're not anywhere near what King dreamed of.â€",0.207,0.593,0.2,-0.0258,0.102,0.821,0.078,-0.9884

At least a half dozen declared or potential presidential candidates will attend events and talk about what King's legacy means to Americans in 2019. Among them is former Vice President Joe Biden, who, amid intense speculation over whether he'll seek the presidency, will make his first public appearance of the year at the National Action Network's annual King breakfast in Washington with its founder, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and Martin Luther King III. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, still considering a bid, is also on the schedule. And New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who jumped in the 2020 race this week, will appear with Sharpton later in the day in Harlem. Meanwhile, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont will attend events in South Carolina, where black voters make up 60 percent of the Democratic primary. And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is expected to speak in Boston, where King attended seminary. The King holiday marks the first time in the early days of the Democratic primary that so many White House hopefuls are holding public events on the same day. That reflects the wide-open nature of the 2020 field, which is likely to include several candidates of color for the first time. Some Democrats say the party's presidential nomination could ultimately go to the person who best navigates racial issues. â€œOn King Day, they should all have messages for how we enable people who live on the outskirts of hope to come back into the circle of opportunity,â€ said Democratic strategist Donna Brazile. â€œThat's what Dr. King would do.â€ Politics loom large over this year's remembrances. In a tweet earlier this week, President Donald Trump again mocked Warren, using the slur â€œPocahontasâ€ and referring to the 19th-century Battle at Little Bighorn and Wounded Knee Massacre. Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, prompted bipartisan criticism with racist remarks that questioned how white supremacy and white nationalism became offensive terms. King has said his comments were taken out of context. Against that backdrop, Sharpton said it's crucial for the candidates speaking on Monday to directly address racial politics. â€œIt will be telling if they do not represent an alternative to the situation we're in,â€ he said, referring to the country's racial divisions. â€œThey've got to deal with the issues in a way that we know that they're not just making a one-day-a-year speech.â€ â€œThe challenge,â€ he added, â€œis how you distinguish yourself without appearing disunifying.â€ Last fall's midterm elections show the potential for assembling such coalitions, with several minority congressional candidates winning in mostly white districts. And while black Democrats suffered defeat in Georgia, Florida and Missouri, the gains they made show promise for minority candidates eyeing 2020. Andrew Gillum, who lost his Florida gubernatorial bid in November by 30,000 votes, has met with several potential 2020 candidates in recent weeks, and he said the topic of race has come up. The issue was unavoidable in his own bid to become Florida's first African-American governor. â€œUnder no circumstance could I deny my race and how that has informed who I am today,â€ Gillum said. â€œPeople aren't stupid. I don't want anyone to pull any punches about how race shows up in society and how it impacts us.â€ But the balance is tricky, particularly for candidates of color, he said. For them, navigating race â€œis like walking on a lake freshly frozen,â€ Gillum said. â€œYou never know what step might take you under.â€ Regardless of their race, Democratic candidates will have to find a way to appeal to a broad coalition of voters with a message that energizes a diverse base without alienating whites whose support will also be crucial. In a video accompanying the launch of her presidential exploratory committee, Warren included a chart outlining the disparate household wealth between white and black families and called for an economy that â€œworks for all of us.â€ A similar video from Gillibrand included broad appeals such as a pledge to support the middle class, along with a clip of her saying, â€œIt is outrageous to ask women of color to bear the burdens of every single one of these fights over and over and over again.â€ Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who is white, defeated African-American challengers in his primary before going on to win a special election in 2017, becoming the first Democrat in a generation to represent the solidly Republican state. Jones said his background as the prosecutor who brought the 16th Street Baptist Church bombers to justice was an advantage with black voters, but added that he also had a proven track record on issues of equality, respect and voting rights long after that case. â€œFolks are going to be looking at candidates and saying, 'Have you got a history of this, or is it just the first time you're looking at it?'â€ Jones said in an interview. â€œI talked about issues important to the African-American community, but they were really a lot of the same issues that were important to the white community: health care, jobs, education, those kitchen-table issues that cross all manner of racial lines and get to the heart of the matter.â€ Authenticity will be important for candidates, regardless of color, in delivering a message that resonates with voters, Jones said. â€œIf you're talking to the black preachers in the Black Belt of Alabama, you ought not be afraid of giving the same speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Madison County,â€ he said. â€œIt's a matter of messaging. You've got to be who you are. ... Not trying to pander to anyone, not to appear that you're pandering to anyone or not trying to minimize your support.â€ Whack is The Associated Press' national writer on race and ethnicity.

MLK,AP,2018,Errin Haines Whack,https://apnews.com/article/d1c1525a13ad45f1a3c975b40f5435e3,Racial firestorm surrounds Trump at MLK holiday,"ATLANTA (AP) — The first Martin Luther King Jr. holiday of Donald Trump's presidency is taking place amid a racial firestorm of Trump's own making. In the same week that he honored King by making a national park out of the ground where King was born and preached until his death, Trump denigrated practically the entire African diaspora, and left many Americans headed into the civil rights icon's birthday convinced that the leader of their country is a racist. For African-Americans in particular, this latest insult from Trump felt like whiplash. Barely a year ago, America's first black president, Barack Obama, marked his final King Day in office with his usual community service; now, his successor is presiding over a racial backlash the country has hardly seen in more than a generation. Trump has denied being racist, labeling himself the â€œleast racist person there isâ€ during his 2016 campaign. Some of his actions leading up to this year's federal holiday honoring King's birth seemed to be an attempt to live up to that. He began last week by designating the historic site around King's Atlanta birth home as a national park. By week's end, Trump was signing a King holiday proclamation with the martyred activist's nephew at his side. But in between, the president sat in a White House meeting on immigration policy and denigrated much of the African diaspora as â€œshithole countriesâ€ while expressing a preference for immigrants from Norway, a majority white nation. This is the type of thing, activists, religious leaders and scholars say, that puts Trump's presidency in direct conflict with the legacy of King, who was assassinated April 4, 1968 while trying to make America a more inclusive society. King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, will be the keynote speaker at the commemorative service honoring her father at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. As is the custom for most presidents, Trump is not expected to participate, but she does hope he will observe the holiday. â€œThis is what I would like President Trump to do: Don't let the King Holiday find you using your Twitter account in an inappropriate way,â€ Bernice King told The Associated Press in an interview. â€œIf he can dare to do that, I would be proud on that day that our president honored Dr. King by not doing things that are offensive.â€ Much of Trump's first year as president has been marked by racial controversy. Last February, Trump kicked off Black History Month by praising long-dead abolitionist Frederick Douglass in the present tense, as if Douglass were still alive. He referred to NFL players protesting systemic racism as â€œsons of bitchesâ€ and suggested they should be benched or fired for their refusal to stand during the national anthem. During a speech to African leaders last fall, he referred to the non-existent country of â€œNambiaâ€ when attempting to discuss Namibia. In June, he said Nigerian immigrants would â€œnever go back to their hutsâ€ after coming to the U.S. King's son, Martin Luther King III, met with Trump on the last King holiday, four days before Trump took office. He spoke to the then-president-elect about the importance of voting rights — only to see Trump establish a now-defunct commission to investigate voter fraud, which some saw as a move to intimidate minority voters. â€œI would like to believe that the president's intentions are not to be divisive, but much of what he says seems or feels to be divisive,â€ King III told AP in an interview. â€œIt would be wonderful to have a president who talked about bringing America together and exhibited that, who was involved in doing a social project ... that would show humility.â€ Civil rights leaders said Friday the president's comments are not new, but are the most recent and glaring proof of Trump's racist views, and shocking to the point that congressional leaders and Americans can no longer ignore his bigotry. â€œThe Trump era ... is a direct assault on the legacy of Dr. King,â€ said the Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of Ebenezer, where King preached for the last eight years of his life. â€œThe conversation about who we are as Americans has shifted and given in to a kind of xenophobia that makes it difficult to discuss issues that affect all Americans.â€ New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who is in Atlanta this weekend being honored by The King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, said â€œmy soul has achedâ€ during Trump's presidency. But Booker, one of two black senators, said Trump's critics must mobilize against his policies or risk being consumed by their own hurt and anger. Paraphrasing King, Booker said, â€œThe problem today is not the vitriolic words and violent actions of the bad people, but the appalling silence and inaction of the good people.â€ During the civil rights movement, King directly confronted and exposed the ills of racism, and led a movement that pressured the American government to end legalized segregation. He spent the last year of his life condemning what he called the â€œtriple evilsâ€ of racism, poverty and war. Bernice King, who serves as the King Center's chief executive, said the lesson of nonviolence is to focus on defeating injustice, not individuals. He said her father's life and work should be applied to the current moment, where racism has again come out into the open. â€œTrump's election could be a blessing in disguise,â€ Bernice King said. â€œThis is the opportunity for America to correct itself.â€ Associated Press reporter Bill Barrow contributed from Atlanta.

MLK,AP,2017,Jonathan Lemire,https://apnews.com/article/c52d15f4946841beb6569a12db86cc94,"Trump, in flap with civil rights icon, meets with MLK's son","NEW YORK (AP) — Days before taking office, President-elect Donald Trump attempted to navigate the fallout of his flap with a civil rights leader and colleague of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. while also losing a member of his incoming administration to accusations of plagiarism. Trump on Monday met with one of King's sons on the holiday marking the life of the slain American icon just days after the president-elect attacked Rep. John Lewis on Twitter. Lewis and the elder King were among the Big Six leaders of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Trump accused Lewis, D-Ga., for being â€œall talkâ€ after Lewis questioned the legitimacy of Trump's election. The president-elect also advised the veteran congressman to pay more attention to his â€œcrime riddenâ€ Atlanta-area district. Trump's comments drew widespread criticism and have done little to reassure those uneasy about the transition from the nation's first black president to a president-elect still struggling to connect with most nonwhite voters. Martin Luther King III downplayed the slight, saying that â€œin the heat of emotion a lot of things get said on both sides.â€ King, who said he pressed Trump on the need for voting reform to increase participation, deemed the meeting â€œconstructive.â€ King said that while he disagreed with the president-elect's comments, he believed â€œat some point in this nation we've got to move forward.â€ â€œHe said that he is going to represent all Americans. He said that over and over again,â€ King told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower after the nearly hourlong meeting. â€œI believe that's his intent, but I think we also have to consistently engage with pressure, public pressure. It doesn't happen automatically.â€ Trump, who struggled for support from minority voters on Election Day, briefly joined King in the lobby but ignored reporters' shouted questions about his comments about Lewis. Lewis had suggested that Trump's November victory was delegitimized due to Russian interference and said he would boycott Friday's Inauguration. More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress have said they will sit out the Trump ceremony. Among them is Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen, who said Monday that â€œthis president 'semi-elect' does not deserve to be president of the United States. He has not exhibited the characteristics or the values that we hold dear.â€ The Martin Luther King holiday is meant to honor community service and volunteerism, and many Americans, including President Barack Obama, spend part of the day doing a service project of some kind. Trump, who cancelled a planned trip to Washington, spent the day inside the Manhattan skyscraper that bears his name. Meanwhile, conservative media commentator Monica Crowley will not be joining the Trump administration following accusations of plagiarism, according to a transition official. Crowley, a frequent on-air presence at Fox News Channel, had been slated to join Trump's National Security Council as a director of strategic communications. On Monday, she withdrew her name from consideration after CNN reported last week that several passages in a 2012 book Crowley wrote were plagiarized. Publisher HarperCollins then pulled the book. Crowley's retreat was first reported by The Washington Times. The transition official confirmed the decision on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Trump has continued to lash out at his critics in the intelligence community and questioned whether the CIA director himself was â€œthe leaker of fake newsâ€ in a Sunday night tweet. The extraordinary criticism from the incoming president came hours after CIA chief John Brennan charged that Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies. â€œNow that he's going to have an opportunity to do something for our national security as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. and national security interests are protected,â€ Brennan said on â€œFox News Sunday,â€ warning that the president-elect's impulsivity could be dangerous. Trump shot back in a Twitter post Sunday, saying: â€œOh really, couldn't do much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the buildup of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?â€ Additionally, European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the EU itself. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the U.S. president-elect's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had â€œcaused astonishment.â€ Trump also said Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation European Union would â€œend up being a great thing,â€ and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — â€œit is the unity of the Europeans.â€ In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: â€œWe Europeans have our fate in our own hands.â€ Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Washington, Steve Peoples in New York, Raf Casert in Brussels and Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report.

MLK,AP,2016,Jeffery Collins,https://apnews.com/general-news-991b83d0c1dc46a194178229367a5675,"With Confederate flag gone, King Day rally shifts focus","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — For the first time in 17 years, civil rights leaders gathered Monday at the South Carolina Statehouse to pay homage to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. without the Confederate flag casting a long shadow over them. The banner was taken down over the summer after police said a young white man who had posed for photos with a rebel flag shot nine black church members to death during a Bible study in Charleston. After the massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Republican Gov. Nikki Haley reversed course and made it a priority for lawmakers to pass legislation to remove the flag. â€œIsn't this a great day? It's so nice to be standing here and not looking at that flag,â€ said Ezell Pittman, who attended most of the King Day anti-flag rallies since they started in 2000. â€œI always had faith it would come down. I hate it took what it did, but was real happy to see it go.â€ Across the country, the 30th anniversary of the holiday to honor the civil rights leader assassinated in 1968 was remembered in different ways. In Michigan, people delivered bottled water to residents of Flint amid the city's drinking water crisis. In Atlanta, an overflow crowd listened as to the nation's housing secretary talk about the 50th anniversary of King's visit to Chicago to launch a campaign for fair housing. Rallies against police brutality in Minnesota and California briefly shut down traffic on two bridges. South Carolina NAACP President Lonnie Randolph said the flag's removal was tangible evidence the state cares about civil rights when pushed hard enough. But he warned there would be other fights ahead. â€œI promise you, the people that gather in this building — your building — will do something this year to cause us to return to ensure freedom, justice and equality is made possible for all people,â€ Randolph said, motioning toward the capitol behind him. Randolph promised to keep coming to the Statehouse until King's dream comes to its full meaning in a state with wide gaps in education achievement between school districts in rich, white communities and poorer, black ones, and where the governor and Republican-dominated Legislature have refused to take federal money to expand Medicaid. About 1,000 people gathered at the Statehouse on a clear, cold day, drawn in part by appearances by all three main Democratic presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Sanders reminded the crowd King was a dynamic leader who wanted to help the poor. O'Malley said King would be ashamed his county has made it harder to vote and easier to buy a gun. Only Clinton dealt directly with the flag. She credited Haley and the Republicans with working with the NAACP after the church shooting and choosing King's legacy over hatred. â€œWe couldn't celebrate him and the Confederacy. We had to choose,â€ Clinton said. â€œAnd South Carolina made the right choice.â€ In the nation's capital, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama followed the King Day theme of community service by planting vegetable seeds at a District of Columbia elementary school to honor the civil rights leader and celebrate Mrs. Obama's anti-childhood obesity initiative. They also stuffed bags with books for needy children along with young people who participate in a White House mentoring program and volunteers from the AmeriCorps national service program. Elsewhere, an overflow crowd showed up at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta to celebrate its former pastor's legacy at an annual commemorative service. It capped more than a week of events under the theme: â€œRemember! Celebrate! Act! King's Legacy of Freedom for Our World.â€ While people have been distracted by TV reality shows and music â€œthat tears down instead of uplifts,â€ many injustices have occurred and â€œwe're about to create right here in this civilized society the wild, wild west with guns,â€ said King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King. â€œY'all, we can't keep being distracted, because if you're not careful, we're about to allow a reality show host to bully himself into becoming president of the United States of America,â€ she said. U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro told the church audience that King moved into a Chicago apartment on the city's west side 50 years ago and described seeing â€œa daily battle against depression and hopelessnessâ€ as babies were attacked by rats and children wore clothes too thin to protect against the Midwest winter. â€œYou see, Dr. King knew that housing was more than about just bricks and mortar,â€ Castro said. In Minneapolis, activists braved frigid temperatures as they marched onto a Mississippi River bridge that connects Minneapolis and St. Paul to protest the deaths of two black men shot by police last year in the Twin Cities. A St. Paul officer was placed on leave while the Police Department investigates allegations that he made a post on Facebook urging drivers to run over protesters. In California, protesters from a Black Lives Matter offshoot group shut down one side of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge when they stopped vehicles in the westbound lanes and chained themselves and the cars together to form a line across the bridge. The California Highway Patrol says 25 people were arrested. Associated Press writer Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report. This story has been corrected to say protesters in California were not from Black Lives Matter, but an offshoot group.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.109,0.79,0.102,-0.4782
MLK,CNN,2024,Kara Nelson,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/14/us/martin-luther-king-legacy-affirmative-action-reaj/index.html,How clashing interpretations of Martin Luther King's legacy fuels the fight over DEI and affirmative action,"More than 60 years have passed since Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his iconic â€œI Have a Dreamâ€ speech at the March on Washington and yet his words still resonate today. â€œI think it's very difficult to find a human being, especially an American, who can hear that speech and not be moved,â€ said Lerone Martin, Director ofthe Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. King's dream– that Black children â€œwill not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character,â€ – is powerful, Martin said, because he was describing â€œwhat America could be, what America should be.â€ But decades later, warring interpretations of one of King's most famous quotes have fueled aculture war over the merits of affirmative action and diversity and inclusion efforts. As each side uses Dr. King's words to justify their stance,historians say we're at risk of erasing the fullness of his legacy and ignoring the long history of discriminatory practices that have fueledinequality in our society today. As a child, legal activist Edward Blum said he grew up discussing civil rights at the dinner table. Decades later, his fightfor equality would take him all the way to the Supreme Court where he was the legal strategist behind Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, the case thatdismantled affirmative actionin college admissions. Blum told CNN he was inspired by King's speech from the March on Washington – specifically the idea that people shouldn't be judged â€œby the color of their skinâ€ –  to launch a lifelong crusadeagainst affirmative action practices. He said he's dedicated his career to trying to â€œre-establish this great legal covenant of color-blindness.â€ â€œAmericans of all races wholly understand that Dr. King's most enduring line from his 'I Have a Dream' speech means that an individual's skin color should not be used to help, or harm, them in their life's endeavors,â€ Blum told CNN. â€œDr. King's [â€œI Have a Dreamâ€] quote means that affirmative action is polarizing, unfair and illegal,â€ he added. But many historians – and at times some of King's own children – have disagreed with the notion that Dr. King would have disavowed affirmative action. Bernice, King's youngest daughter, has at times been a vocal critic on social media of what she has described as the repeated misuse of her father's quotes, especially ones from his â€œI Have a Dreamâ€ speech. â€œPeople using 'not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character' to deter discussion of, teaching about, and protest against racism are not students of the comprehensive MLK,â€ Kingposted last Auguston X, formerly known as Twitter. â€œMy father's dream and work included eradicating racism, not ignoring it.â€ Opinion: Why Martin Luther King Jr.'s sharpest question remains unanswered Martin said he feels reducing Dr. King's legacy to a single quote in a speech diminishes the gains the civil rights leader fought for. He encourages critics of race-based affirmative action and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts to look at the breadth of King's work, including his final book published in 1967, â€œWhere Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community.â€ In the book, King wrote, â€œa society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for the Negro.â€ Martin said this context underscores how King felt about affirmative action, which became law through an executive order in 1965. Instead, the â€œI Have a Dreamâ€ quote, Martin said, has been repeatedly repurposed â€œas a quote to call for the dismantling of various mechanisms that were intended to bring about a more equitable society.â€ â€œI've seen [King's words] be misunderstood as a call for color-blindness,â€ he said. â€œColorblindness asks us to explain systemic racial inequality by using 'raceless' explanations. It asks us to explain or solve a phenomenon but bars us from addressing the root cause of the phenomenon.â€ Shayla Nunnally, professor of political science and Africana studies at the University of Tennessee, agreed, and believes King would not have supported the decision to dismantle affirmative action. â€œI say that because I think accounting for ways that we can make society more inclusive would have been a part of that vision for Dr. King,â€ she said. Nunnally said the fight over affirmative action ultimately comes down to whether you believe the â€œdreamâ€ King spoke of that day has already been achieved. â€œWe would have hoped that this would have been something that we saw fully change by the end of the Civil Rights Movement, but that's not the case,â€ she said. Martin said as long as race remains a â€œstrong determinant of where one lives, goes to school, income, encounters with police,â€ he feels American society still has a long way to go before achieving Dr. King's dream. While they disagree on whether King would have supported affirmative action and DEI to bring about a more inclusive society, both Blum and Martin said America must continue King's work to dismantle the legacy of racism. â€œMost Americans don't think how someone looks, tells them much about who they are as an individual,â€ Blum said. â€œAnd that is a deeply embedded American belief.â€ Martin said he sees our country's progress toward King's vision as an ongoing journey. â€œIf you take [King] at his fullness, you'll realize that we have a long way to go before we fully arrive at the society which we dreamed about and spoke about and encouraged us to become,â€ he said.",0.148,0.852,0.0,-0.3818,0.079,0.837,0.084,-0.2071

Don't tell us what you believe in, show us with your votes. History will be watching what happens tomorrow,â€ Martin Luther King III, son ofMartin Luther King Jr.said in a speech in Washington, DC. â€œBlack and brown Americans will be watching what happens tomorrow. In 50 years, students will read about what happens tomorrow and know whether our leaders had the integrity to do the right thing.â€ His comments come on the federal holiday honoring the late civil rights leader and a day before the Senateis expected to take up voting rights legislationthat faces uncertainty amid opposition among Democrats. The King family and activist groups have been urging President Joe Biden and Congress to act on voting rights legislation that has stalled in the Senate. â€œIf you can deliver an infrastructure bill for bridges, you can deliver voting rights for Americans. If you do not, there is no bridge in this nation that can hold the weight of that failure,â€ he continued. On Monday morning, the King family gathered with other activist groups and marched across the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge. Their message to Biden and Congress: â€œYou delivered for bridges, now deliver for voting rights.â€ They marked what would have been King Jr.'s 93rd birthday in Phoenixon Saturday, where they pushed for the President and Congress to pass the voting rights legislation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Joyce Beatty, Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and activist groups also joined the King family at the news conference on Monday, calling for the Senate to act. â€œIf you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy,â€ Pelosi said, in reference to changing the Senate filibuster rules necessary to pass the legislation. During the National Action Network's annual breakfast honoring King on Monday, Biden echoedthe same message he delivered in Georgialast week where he said lawmakers must choose to stand on the side of civil rights leaders such as King or on the side of segregationists like former Alabama Gov. George Wallace. â€œThe attack on our democracy is real, from the January 6th insurrection to the onslaught of Republican's anti-voting laws in a number of states,â€ Biden said in pre-recorded remarks. â€œIt's no longer just about who gets to vote. It's about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all. It's about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion.â€ The President continued, â€œWe're in another moment right now where the mirror is being held up to America, being held up again. The question being asked again: Where do we stand? Whose side are we on?â€ Vice President Kamala Harris also called on the Senate to pass voting rights legislation, saying during the Martin Luther King Jr. Beloved Community Commemorative Service at Ebenezer Baptist Church to truly honor King Jr.'s legacy, â€œWe must continue to fight for the freedom to vote, for freedom for all.â€ â€œToday, our freedom to vote is under assault,â€ Harris said in virtual remarks on Monday. â€œIt is time for the United States Senate to do its job. â€¦ The Senate must pass this bill, now.â€ Democrats have been searching for a way to pass voting rights legislation amid the pressure and pushback from members of their own party. Influential moderateSens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, two Democrats who have long expressed opposition to changing filibuster rules – necessary to get voting legislation over the finish line – remain unmoved. â€œSenator Sinema and Senator Manchin want a supermajority. Well, a supermajority of citizens support this legislation,â€ Arndrea Waters King, wife of Martin Luther King III, said Monday, adding that if both senators maintain their positions they will â€œextend White supremacy's chokehold on our democracy.â€ Martin Luther King III also criticized both senators and said, â€œHistory will not remember them kindly.â€ CNN reached out to Sinema's and Manchin's offices for comment.

But despite the limitations of the season, this federal holiday doesn't have to be any less impactful. Now more than ever, MLK Day of Service is enabling everyday people to roll up their sleeves and help their communities – even while stuck at home. Here's how: A post shared by TheKingCenter (@thekingcenter) Without the hassle of finding parking or forgetting your facemask at home, one way to spread goodwill on MLK Day is by making at-home care packages for those in need of cheer.Operation Gratitudeis offering a number of virtual ways to spread joy to frontline workers and military members. With convenience in mind, this organization has set up anAmazon wish listthrough the Amazon Smile Program. After purchase, items like socks, sunscreen, and beef jerky are shipped to Operation Gratitude. From there, care packages are assembled and sent to those on the front lines. â€œVolunteers are the heart and soul of Operation Gratitude,â€ says Danielle Teconi, the organization's communications director. A post shared by Operation Gratitude (@opgratitude) â€œAnyone, from anywhere, can participate from home, as it's self-guided and self-paced,â€ she explains. As an added perk, eligible purchases made through the organization's wish list will kick back a small donation to the charity. For crafty volunteers, Operation Gratitude also offers a step-by-step guide on how to make eye-catching letters of gratitude for military personnel and essential workers. A post shared by Operation Gratitude (@opgratitude) And, for those who sew, volunteers can lend their talents on MLK Day to create knitted crafts as a part of the organization's Hand Made with Love initiative. Soft keepsakes like crochet hats, scarves and handmade bags can cheer up deployed troops when home feels far away. A post shared by Operation Gratitude (@opgratitude) This year's day of service provides a timely opportunity to learn about existing public health disparities made worse for communities of color by Covid-19. In honor of Dr. King's commitment to public health access,Global Citizen 365is hosting a national conversation on â€œJustice and the Covid-19 Health Crisis.â€ The online event will take place via Zoom at 3 pm Eastern on Martin Luther King Day. To teach the next generation of change agents, the organization is hosting a virtualread-aloud recording. Global Citizen 365 is seeking volunteers willing to film an animated selfie-video. Those interested are asked to record themselves reading a children's book about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights or civic engagement. Once submitted, the non-profit will post the videos online and share them with families. At a time when so many people are in pain, you can sustain life. To learn where to donate blood, enter your zip code into the searchtoolset up by theAmerican Red Cross. According to its website, the American Red Cross has a special need for donations from fully-recovered coronavirus survivors. Those who have fully recovered from the virus are urged to consider donating convalescent plasma. The convalescent plasma of fully recovered coronavirus survivors may contain antibodies helpful to critically ill Covid patients. Another way to help sustain life on MLK Day is by volunteering to become a bone marrow donor with Be The Match. Bone marrow donations can save the lives of individuals battling blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, as well as blood disorders like sickle cell disease. Be The Match has an urgent plea for donations from communities of color—especially Black and African-American individuals. Of the organization's more than 22 million member registry, only 4% identify as Black or African American. A post shared by NMDP (@nmdp_org) Due to the lack of representation, Be The Match says Black and African American patients are among the least likely to find a match. According to Kate McDermott, a public relations specialist at the organization, Black and African-American people only have a 23% chance of finding a suitable donor. â€œThat number is unacceptable to us. We want to make sure that all of our patients regardless of ethnic background are able to find the match that they need,â€ she tells CNN. â€œOur mission is equal outcomes for all.â€ To encourage life-saving donations, Be The Match says it has created the Race Against Time campaign to urge communities of color to come forward to help sustain lives of color impacted by blood-related diseases. A post shared by NMDP (@nmdp_org) As the pandemic forced people to prioritize physical health over mental wellness, many elderly citizens have suffered in silence. Programs like theSelfhelp's Virtual Senior Centerprogram are seeking volunteers eager to share meaningful moments and smiles with seniors. At-home volunteers are needed to facilitate hour-long virtual classes for their senior students based on interests, hobbies and expertise.

For some, this year's celebration is clouded by conflict, increasing racial division and deteriorating social circumstances. But the late civil rights leader's daughter Bernice King believes there is no better time to build community. Bernice King also believes America needs his teaching more now than ever. In â€œWhere Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?â€ the last book written by King's father to be published in his lifetime, he wrote: â€œWe are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late.â€ â€œIn this critical hour and contentious climate, not only in the United States but in the world, I believe that we need to pay attention to these words from my father,â€ said King. â€œWe cannot spiritually, relationally or globally afford to ignore the injustice and inhumanity and must work fervently to build the beloved community,â€ she said. As CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, King preserves her father's legacy and promotes his philosophies of non-violence, justice and community. People are divided today because they are disconnected, something she believes her father would try to change, she said. Related videoBernice King: Desperately need father's voice â€œHumanity engaging each other as a human family in our World House greatly depends on us understanding our interrelatedness and interconnectedness.â€ â€œAs Daddy said, 'We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.' Our very survival hinges on us, recognizing this.â€ King believes that this recognition should lead to bolder actions like courageous conversations addressing the pain of racism and injustice. â€œTruth is essential,â€ she said. â€œWe really struggle with facing the truth of this nation's history and of the devastating, dehumanizing impact of slavery, Jim Crow, and the racism that persists today. So, we need to have some courageous conversations and some repentance as a nation.â€ â€œWe have to understand the connection between peace, love, and justice. Once we understand this connection, we can begin to more strategically build the consciousness and the coalitions to change unjust systems and to correct hate.â€ Asked if she felt her father's dream has been deferred, King noted the victories but said there's work to be done to sustain the gains. â€œWhen we are not diligent and attentive, people with injustice in mind will, with great diligence and attention, destroy what's been built and try to reverse progress.â€ To King, now is not a time for apathy or complacency. It is time for positive action. â€œWe have to understand my father's teachings and his work in a comprehensive way,â€ she said. â€œThat will help us embrace the love ethic, but also be able to actualize love by treating each other with dignity and respect and in pursuit of true peace, which includes justice.â€",0.0,0.833,0.167,0.25,0.137,0.683,0.179,0.9804

The upcoming Martin Luther King Jr. holiday takes on added significance this year, on what would have been a special birthday for the iconic civil rights leader. On Tuesday, January 15, 2019, Martin Luther King Jr. would have turned 90 years old. Of course, King did not even live to reach middle age, being cut down by an assassin's bullet while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on Thursday, April 4, 1968. The Lorraine Motel is now a national civil rights museum, offering a hopeful sign of the immense political and social transformations that have taken place since that fateful day. Because of this 90th milestone, however, this year's King holiday offers an annual opportunity for the nation to take stock of the struggle for black citizenship that turned a Baptist preacher from Atlanta, Georgia, into a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. It also allows us to assess the full measure of King's message of racial equality, economic justice, and peace in our own time. Americans too often praise the man while ignoring the message. Martin Luther King Jr.'s resounding and living legacy informs a range of contemporary social movements fighting for civil and human rights for the most marginalized and oppressed populations in America and around the world. King defined a â€œbeloved communityâ€ as a place not only free of injustice, but a society that actively promotes an ethic of love, justice, and humanity in its legal, political, and civic life, as well as its religious, spiritual, and moral spheres. King balanced a scathing indictment against war, racism, poverty, and materialism toward the end of his life with a defiant political optimism rooted in his faith that millions of Americans could mobilize a nonviolent army of the dispossessed, capable of fundamentally transforming the political and economic status quo. Related articleWho is Martin Luther King Jr. to us, 50 years later? King's search for racial justice and black citizenship found him consistently decrying the yawning gap between the lofty rhetoric of American democracy and its at times brutal reality. This gap continues to grow in our own time, visible in the comments made by Rep. Steve King and highlighted by President Trump's efforts to build a wall at the nation's borders at the expense of America's national prestige and the rising cost of a government shutdown. As CNN has reported, Democratic Whip James Clyburn introduced a resolution condemning the Iowa legislator, saying Monday: â€œI rise today to address what I call a tale of two Kings. One, a member of this body, who wondered out loud to the New York Times why the terms 'white nationalism' and 'white supremacy are offensive. I will say to my colleague the terms are offensive because the concepts are evilâ€¦I have just introduced a resolution to express this august body's disapproval of Mr. King's comments and condemnation of white nationalism and white supremacy in all firms. So today I denounce the words of Rep. Steve King and I do so invoking the words of another king, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, who if would have been allowed to live, would be celebrating his 90th birthday tomorrow.â€ Celebrations of the King holiday this year take place in the shadow of mass unemployment imposed by the President over an issue that many see as dehumanizing. The partial shutdown, which affects many historic civil rights museums and memorials including the National Museum for African-American History in Washington,means thathundreds of thousands of Americans who planned on taking pilgrimages to visit these sites will be denied the opportunity. The human cost on the nearly 800,000 federal employees who are no longer being paid is growing larger each day, with workers already living paycheck to paycheck struggling to provide for their families in the midst of what has been a crisis manufactured by the White House but most acutely felt by ordinary Americans. President Trump's efforts to erect a wall,at the costof the personal dignity of federal workers and America's international reputation as a nation of immigrants, represents the exact kind of abuse of power that King spent his life fighting against. Related videoCivil rights icons visit site of MLK's death At his best, King painted a picture of American society poised at a historical crossroads that would decide both the destiny of democracy and the limits of human potential around the world. On March 31, 1968, King delivered the Passion Sunday sermon to the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, wherehe declaredthat â€œthe goal of America is freedom.â€ Contemporary American politics, featuring debates over building walls, legislation designed to suppress voting rights, and widespread racial and economic inequality, betrays King's legacy even as national historical markers and civil rights museums celebrate the man. King's full-throated support for racial and economic justice can be seen in our own time in a wide spectrum of voices, from theMoral Monday effortsin North Carolina led by the Rev. William J. Barber, to the â€œGreen New Dealâ€advocated byNew York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Efforts to demonize Ocasio-Cortez – a self-styled social democrat – coming from those who laud Martin Luther King Jr. reveal howout of touchAmerica is with who King really was. Martin Luther King Jr. publicly supported the social-democratic governments that he visited during his European tour in 1964, when he traveled to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Within three years, Kingcalled fora guaranteed income for all people as part of his Poor People's Movement to eradicate poverty, violence, and racism in America. Related articleThis speech made Martin Luther King Jr. revolutionary Celebrations of King in our own times have often split him into two. The â€œgood Kingâ€ delivered a sermon for the ages at the March On Washington, promoted nonviolence as the key to achieving racial justice, and served as a friend and adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson that made it possible to pass major civil rights and voting rights legislation. The â€œbad King,â€ criticized at the time by major newspapers, clergy, and politicians, boldly denounced the Vietnam War as immoral, linked the shortcomings of the Great Society to global war and domestic riots, and called for an American citizenship expansive enough to guarantee jobs, housing, food, and justice to the poor living in a vast sea of wealth. The radical King's influence is best seen in the political actions of a new generation of activists, organizers, and young people, who honor his continuing legacy with deeds that push the nation closer toward the beloved community. King defined that community as not only a world free of racism, war, and poverty. He argued that justice was what love looked like in public, and that all citizens could achieve greatness through a purpose-driven life of service. King offered an example to all Americans that a life dedicated to the mission of social justice and human rights represents our ultimate purpose and greatest vocation. Join us onTwitterandFacebook He inspired American citizens, presidents, and the nation-state to take moral stands that entailed political consequences, something sorely missing from our national public and civic discourse. The issues of racism, poverty, voter suppression, housing inequality, unemployment, violence, and war that plagued King's era remain. However, the key difference between then and now is the evolution of the civil rights struggle from one dominated by a singular voice to a contemporary landscape featuring multiple leaders who, in the best tradition of King, are stirring national debate over the meaning of freedom, democracy, justice, and citizenship.",0.182,0.559,0.26,0.1027,0.126,0.735,0.139,0.9218
MLK,CNN,2018,John Blake,https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/12/us/mlk-relevance-today/index.html,Three ways MLK speaks to our time,"“Every hero becomes a bore at last.” That’s a famous line from the 19th century philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, but it could also apply to a modern American hero: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. As the nation celebrates King’s national holiday Monday, it’s easy to freeze-frame him as the benevolent dreamer carved in stone on the Washington Mall. Yet the platitudes that frame many King holiday events often fail to mention the most radical aspects of his legacy, says Jeanne Theoharis, a political science professor at Brooklyn College and author of several books on the civil rights movement. “We turn him into a Thanksgiving parade float, he’s jolly, larger than life and he makes us feel good,” Theoharis says. “We’ve turned him into a mascot.” Many people vaguely know that King opposed the Vietnam War and talked more about poverty in his later years. But King also had a lot to say about issues not normally associated with civil rights that still resonate today, historians and activists say. If you’re concerned about inequality, health care, climate change or even the nastiness of our political disagreements, then King has plenty to say to you. To see that version of King, though, we have to dust off the cliches and look at him anew. If you’re more familiar with your smartphone than your history, try this: Think of King not just as a civil rights hero, but also as an app – his legacy has to be updated to remain relevant. Here are three ways we can update our MLK app to see how he spoke not only to his time, but to our time as well: No. 1: He’s an environmental hero When former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at a King commemorative event in 2011, he described King in an unusual way: King, he said, helped “plant the seeds for what would become our nation’s now-thriving environmental justice movement.” People don’t think of King as an ecological activist. He didn’t live long enough to see the environmental movement take off. He died just a few months before the Apollo 8 astronauts took the iconic “Earthrise” photo over the moon, which is often credited with sparking widespread environmental awareness.. There’s a connection between what King was saying in the 1950s and ’60s and this explosion of ecological thinking that emerged around 1970, where everyone was saying it’s all about interconnectedness.” Drew Dellinger, author and activist, on King's environmental legacy. But he still inspires environmental activists because they say he was so eloquent in articulating a core belief of their movement: the interconnected nature of life. One of the most difficult challenges climate change activists face today is convincing political and business leaders to act on behalf of future generations and people in other parts of the world. King, though, offers a great example of how to address this challenge, some say. He constantly talked about the interconnectedness of life. In his “A Christmas Sermon on Peace” just five months before his assassination, King delivered one of his most famous quotes: “All life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. We are made to live together because of the interrelated structure of reality.” Some even describe King as an ecological hero. Activist and author Drew Dellinger says King’s insight is profound. “That’s the essence of ecology,” says Dellinger, who wrote an essay for Common Ground magazine entitled, “Martin Luther King Jr.: Ecological Thinker.” “The first law of ecology is that everything is connected.” Other environmental activists have noticed King as well. In his essay, Dellinger cites Larry L. Rasmussen, author of “Earth-honoring Faith” and a professor emeritus of social ethics at Union Theological Seminary, describing King as “one of the great ecological thinkers of the 20th century.” King wrote more about nature and the fragility of life on Earth than people realize, says Dellinger. King once warned that “cities are gasping in polluted air and enduring contaminated water.” Dellinger also cites this quote from King: “It would be foolhardy for me to work for integrated schools or integrated lunch counters and not be concerned about the survival of the world in which to be integrated.” When he was pouring through King’s sermons and books, Dellinger says, he discovered constant references to science and nature. He came across notecards written in King’s hand rhapsodizing about “all this galaxy of wonder” and “stars that guide sailors in storms.” “There’s a connection between what King was saying in the 1950s and ’60s and this explosion of ecological thinking that emerged around 1970, where everyone was saying it’s all about interconnectedness,” Dellinger says. Gwendolyn Keyes Fleming, a former EPA regional administrator who wrote about King’s environmental legacy, says King also inspired a generation of activists in the 1970s and ’80s who fought to remove landfills that had been placed near communities of color. “If you go back to the beginnings of the environmental justice movement, a lot of those folks were active civil rights advocates at the time,” says Keys, now a partner in the DC law firm of Van Ness Feldman. “Even Congressman John Lewis said that environmental justice is one of the modern civil rights issues of our time.” No. 2: He was a socialist before it was cool
There was a time in American politics when calling someone a socialist was a slur. Not anymore, at least for many younger Americans who are developing a distrust of capitalism. One of the most popular politicians in recent times is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist who almost captured the Democratic nomination for president. A 2016 Harvard University poll said 51% of young Americans – 18- to-29-year-olds – oppose capitalism. And a poll conducted the next year by YouGov and the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that most American millennials preferred to live in a socialist country than a capitalist one. The reasons why some millennials prefer socialism have been documented. Lingering scars from the Great Recession; staggering student debt; the greatest economic inequality since before the Great Depression – all have contributed to an unease about capitalism. King had similar misgivings. Many historians describe him as a “democratic socialist,” someone who, according to the Democratic Socialists of America, believes the economy should be shaped “to meet public needs” and “not to make profits for a few.”
King called for universal health care and education, a guaranteed annual income and the nationalization of some industries. He was a big supporter of unions, and while there was no Fight for 15 campaign to raise the minimum wage during his time, he once said even menial workers should make enough “so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life.” When King was assassinated in 1968, he was about lead a multiracial army of poor people into Washington to force the nation’s political leaders to address poverty. “He saw that changing the laws was important but that was not in itself sufficient,” says Jerald Podair, a history professor at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. “There had to be some sort of redistribution of economic power.” How radical was King’s vision? He spelled out it on many occasions: In 1968, he told a church audience: “It didn’t cost the nation a penny to open lunch counters. It didn’t cost the nation a penny to give us the right to vote. But it will cost the nation billions to feed and house all of its citizens. The country needs a radical redistribution of wealth.” In a 1966 speech to his staff, he said: “There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.” In 1964, after traveling to Norway to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, King said: Today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes.” “In both Norway and Sweden, whose economies are literally dwarfed by the size of our affluence and the extent of our technology, they have no unemployment and no slums. There, men, women and children have long enjoyed free medical care and quality education. This contrast to the limited, halting steps taken by our rich nation deeply troubled me.” Even one of King’ s most utopian visions – a guaranteed income – is getting serious discussion today because of fears that automation will erase many jobs. There’s even a new proposal to give every newborn in the US “Baby Bonds,” accounts between $500 and $50,000 that parents couldn’t touch until their kids turn 18, as a way to combat inequality. There are those who say King gravitated toward socialism later in his life. But like many Americans today, he saw its possibilities first as a young man. In a letter to his future wife, Coretta Scott, a 20-something King wrote: “I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic … So today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes.”
No. 3: He never let a political disagreement turn nasty “Reverend Dr. Chickenwing.” “A religious Uncle Tom.” A “traitor” and a “chump.” That’s how one prominent black leader described King when he was alive. That leader was Malcolm X. While his denunciations of King and other leaders is well known, here’s a remarkable fact: There is virtually no record of King making a personal or petty attack against Malcolm X or any other black leaders who criticized him. This could be an important lesson at a time of bitter political divisions, which are often made worse by social media. Two contemporary leaders in the civil rights movement recently got involved in a Twitter feud that turned personal. The clash between Harvard professor Cornel West and award-winning Ta-Nehisi Coates revolved around political philosophy. But it became so heated that Coates ended up deleting his Twitter account. “We turn him into a Thanksgiving parade float, he’s jolly, larger than life and he makes us feel good. We’ve turned him into a mascot.
Jeanne Theoharis, author of ""A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History""King received a cascade of petty insults from Malcolm X and other black leaders during his time, but King’s faith tempered his response, says Podair, the historian. “He was a Christian minister, and he talked about trying to love segregationists, and if you try to have empathy for your enemies, you can also do that with your rivals in civil rights organizations,” says Podair , who writes about race in his latest book, “City of Dreams: Dodger Stadium and the Birth of Modern Los Angeles.” There was also a pragmatic side to King’s reluctance to get pulled into public feuds. It preserved alliances and kept the door open to new allies – including Malcolm X. After Malcolm broke with the Nation of Islam in 1964, he started reaching out to King and other civil rights leaders. He traveled to Selma, Alabama, in 1965, where King was leading the march to Montgomery, to offer support. A friend of Malcolm once said the former Nation of Islam leader believed King “would be the most responsive” of all civil rights leaders to his efforts to reconcile. “He had come to believe that King believed in what he was doing,” A. Peter Bailey told CNN in 2010 “He believed in nonviolence; it just wasn’t a show. He developed respect for him. I heard him say you have to give respect to men who put their lives on the line.” The respect was mutual. When King later learned that Malcolm X had come to Selma to support him, he was quoted as saying, “Hey, that Malcolm is a beautiful brother.” “He always had a deep affection for Malcolm,” says Jacob Udo-Udo Jacob, a visiting international scholar in international studies at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. “Malcolm obviously challenged and did say many unkind words about King’s philosophy of nonviolence, but their disagreements never turned personal or nasty.” King’s magnanimous nature didn’t just help him deal with other black leaders’ insults. It also helped him deal with something people today may find hard to believe: He was persistently unpopular during his lifetime, says Theoharis, the Brooklyn College political science professor and author of “A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History.” “One of the things that people erase from history is how unpopular and scared of Dr. King most Americans were at the times,” she says. “I’m not just talking about in ’67 and ‘68, but I’m talking about in the early ‘60s.”Theoharis cites King’s most transcendent moment: The 1963 March on Washington and his “I have a Dream” speech. Polls showed that most Americans didn’t approve of the march, and the following year – well before the 1965 Voting Rights Act was passed – a New York Times poll showed that most Americans thought the civil rights movement had gone too far. The US government thought King was so dangerous they treated him like an enemy of the state. “We now see his March on Washington speech as the greatest American speech of the 20th century,” she says, “but we’re uncomfortable grappling with the fact that this is the moment that the FBI decided to have wall-to-wall surveillance of Dr. King.”Today we have wall-to-wall celebrations about King. He’s now on par with American titans like Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Americans write tributes and sing songs about how much King has changed America. But here’s one more uncomfortable thought that also explains why King remains so relevant: The country is still divided by many of the same issues that consumed him. On the last night of his life, King told a shouting congregation of black churchgoers that “we as a people” would get to “the Promised Land.” That kind of optimism, though, sounds like it belongs to another era. What we have now is a leader in the White House who denies widespread reports that he complained about Latino and African immigrants coming to America from “shithole” countries; a white supremacist who murders worshippers in church; a social media landscape that pulsates with anger and accusations. King’s Promised Land doesn’t sound boring when compared to today’s headlines. And maybe that’s what’s so sad about reliving his life every January for some people. Fifty years after he died, King’s vision for America still sounds so far away.

A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of â€œCooking with Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.â€ The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Donna Brazile: Had he lived, Martin Luther King Jr. would have turned 87 on Friday She says he would have been urging a more inclusive America, as we still try to overcome racial inequality This Monday, we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the federal holiday in honor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. It's a holiday that thankfully has been gaining in recognition since Congress passed a bill and President Ronald Reagan signed it in 1983, designating the third Monday in January, starting in 1986, to honor the civil rights leader. For years, some states declined to participate in the holiday, and Arizona lost the opportunity to host a Super Bowl over it. In 2000, South Carolina became the last state to recognize the holiday. Still, a Bloomberg BNA surveyfound last yearthat fewer than 40% of American workers are given the day off – about the same as Presidents Day and far behind the nearly universal observance of such holidays as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Memorial Day, July 4 and Labor Day. Whether or not you have the day off, it's worth reflecting on the life and philosophy of the man we honor Monday. Had an assassin's bullet not taken his life at the age of 39, King would have turned 87 on Friday. Had he lived, I believe King would have continued to inspire hope and would challenge us to fulfill his dream of a more inclusive society – where everyone would have an equal opportunity for â€œlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.â€ No doubt King, who was passionate about justice and equality for all, would have been proud of all the milestones we have achieved as a nation, including the election of our first black president of the United States. Nevertheless, King would have urged us to move beyond our internal divisions of political partisanship and to find common ground. King believed that â€œhate is too great a burden to bearâ€ and that we should not â€œseek to satisfy our thirst of freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.â€ So, where are we on race relations? Is it OK to even talk about it? Some say â€œcolor blindnessâ€ means that even mentioning race is wrong – even when pointing out an injustice. As we have seen over the last few years, the country has stumbled backward. Not only are we reopening old wounds with regard to confrontation with law enforcement, we are also relitigating everything from voting rights to affirmative action. And now we confront, for the second year in a row, Hollywood – which somehow ignores the talent of people of color when it comes to the Oscars. (#Oscars so white) With the headlines screaming about everything from black young men being gunned down by police in Chicago to mass incarceration, and with officials ignoring calls for reconciliation – or worse, blaming poor people for their own predicament – it's easy to become depressed, apathetic or simply give up. But that is not King's legacy. He saw defeats as temporary. He saw opposition as a challenge. He believed that most people want truth and justice, that most people would lend their voices to promote the freedom and dignity of all. It was his faith, determination and hope, as much as his words, that sustained and inspired a generation to be actively engaged in the political process as voters – and thus working to transform our nation by electing men and women of valor who sought to remove barriers and open once-closed doors to all. That was part of King's vision – as he stated back in 1957 when he called on the country to â€œgive us the ballot.â€ King once said, â€œIf you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl. But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.â€ We can thank King's generation and their children for the fact that open racism, based on hatred, is no longer acceptable in America. Malicious racism is largely behind us. Yet, for many blacks and other people of color, our journey is not over as we strive to get to King's â€œpromised land.â€ Little girls attending Sunday school are no longer being bombed, with the perpetrators going unpunished for decades. But we still have too many instances like Sandra Bland being found dead in her jail cell or young men being fatally shot as they walked, unarmed, peacefully away from law enforcement. Justice seems elusive. So how do we honor King when there are those in our society who continue to exploit racial fears and to demonize those from different religious backgrounds or traditions? No one knew better than King of disappointment, yet he remained determined not to be discouraged. He saw in his own lifetime that racism was shifting from malicious, violent discrimination to softer means such as excluding people from voting, or from access to promotions in the workplace, or from access to certain careers, or from ever being able to rise above hand-to-mouth wages and salaries. The good news is, despite an onslaught of politicians who have a vested interest in excusing and fostering bias based on racial fears, Pew Research finds that the majority of Americans believethe country needs to continueto take measures to give equal rights to blacks and everyone. We remain in a struggle to fight racism, a struggle all the tougher because racism has gone underground or hides its true intentions. Some studies refer to it as unconscious bias. Twenty-first century racism wears many disguises, including stereotyping immigrants as criminals – with only some being â€œgood people.â€ The new racism holds that those who do the discriminating are actually the victims of discrimination, if a policy seeks to give people of color more access to their â€œarea.â€ We must continue to find ways to achieve racial reconciliation through dialogue and by working together to tear down institutional racism that prevents some folks with names like Janae or Jamil from being called in for an interview, though they meet the qualifications. Finally, King believed in diversity. Diversity, the chorus of different voices, should be a song of harmony. As Americans, we cannot deny our heritage, our individual cultures, but rather we must continue to bring all that is good and just to the civic enterprise. King's legacy is action in the service of others. For he believed that â€œnot everybody can be famous, but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service.â€ So, whether on the job or off, let's use this day to commit ourselves to service through acts of goodness and kindness. Let's continue his work in the vineyards of justice and equality for all. And let us begin to live in what King called â€œthe fierce urgency of now.â€ Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.11,0.746,0.144,0.9876

Gen Z and Millennials told The New York Times that after the Supreme Courtoverturned Roe v.

July4th,FOX,2019,Paul Steinhauser,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-dems-target-trump-dnc-as-they-march-in-nh-july-4th-parade,"2020 Dems target Trump, and the DNC, as they march in NH July 4 parade","The White House insists that President Trump's 'Salute to America' event on July Fourth is not politically motivated; Rich Edson reports. AMHERST, NH – The four Democratic presidential contenders marching in this New Hampshire town's storied Independence Day parade took aim at Republican President Donald Trump over a much larger July 4th celebration he's holding in the nation's capital. CONTROVERSY OVER TRUMP'S JULY 4TH 'CELEBRATION OF A LIFETIME' Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – an Iraq War veteran – on Thursday slammed the president for holding a â€œSalute to Americaâ€ event at the Lincoln Memorial on Independence Day. â€œI think it dishonors our troops, dishonors our service members and veterans,â€ the congresswoman emphasized. â€œBecause it's really all about Trump. It's not about our service members, it's not about their sacrifices it's not about my brothers and sisters who lost their lives in service to this country and that's the most unfortunate thing.â€ Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also fired away at Trump, telling reporters  â€œI think it's a waste of money, you know he's having a parade for himself, putting tanks out there for himself, and if he really cares about  The men and women of our nation he would be investing in higher pay, better housing, better healthcare.â€ The tanks she referred to are M1A1 Abrams tanks, which will be part of the celebration. They were transported to the nation's capital from Fort Stewart in Georgia. Scores of Democratic lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration over politicizing a holiday that celebrates the nation's independence from Great Britain, and over the reported $2.5 million the National Park Service is using to help cover the costs of Trump's celebration. And there are concerns the weight of the tanks could crush the streets they're rolling over during the festivities. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota vented that â€œit really bothered me what the president is doing with the tanks and hopefully the pavement is not going to buckle in Washington, D.C., and all of the money on that.â€ Trump has defended the holding of the celebration, touting that it will be ""the show of a lifetime!"" The July 4 holiday comes a week after the first round of Democratic presidential primary debates – which appear to have up-ended the nomination battle among a historic two-dozen White House hopefuls. â€œI think it's starting to reshape the race,â€ former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland told Fox News. â€œI do think things are starting to change in the race.â€ What will also change are the thresholds for the candidates to make the debate stage for the third and fourth rounds in September and October. The DNC announced in late May that to qualify for the third and fourth round of debates – which will be held in September and October – candidates must receive 2 percent or more support in at least four national or early voting state polls recognized by the national party. The threshold for the first two rounds of debates is 1 percent in three polls. And candidates must also receive contributions from a minimum 130,000 unique donors, as well as 400 unique donors in at least 20 states. The 130,000 threshold is double the 65,000 needed to make the debate stage at the first two rounds, and the 400 donors in each state is double the 200 currently needed. The DNC's mandates to candidates to clear both the polling and donor hurdles is a switch from the first two rounds, when the contenders only had to hit one of the criteria. Delaney argued that â€œI believe in the fullness of time that this is going to be viewed as a disastrous decision.â€ Gabbard also took aim at the DNC, telling Fox News that the raising of the bar is â€œcreating a situation where voters will have less choicesâ€¦. I think the best thing for our democracy is to make sure that everybody's got as much exposure as possible so that voters can make that choice for themselves.â€ Klobuchar, who said she's in good shape to reach the new criteria, defended the DNC. â€œThey have to have some criteria, because it's hard for people to decide when there's 20,â€ she said. â€œI don't have a problem with them narrowing it down, as long as I'm still in it. It's kind of a 'Hunger Games' situation.â€ For the DNC, grappling with roughly two-dozen candidates is uncharted waters. The Democratic field easily tops the then-record 18 Republicans running for the GOP's 2016 presidential nomination. DNC Chairman Tom Perez called the threshold-raising a normal procedure. The Amherst parade, which attracts a bevy of White House hopefuls every for years, allows the candidates to showcase their retail politics skills - which are crucial in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire. Minutes before marching, Delaney shared his parade strategy. â€œI like to move around and just try to meet as many people as possible on the side of the parade, go back and forth.â€ And with the temperatures steady climbing, Delaney acknowledged that â€œyou know you get a little sweaty doing it, but you meet a lot of folks. And that's kind of how I handle parades.â€ Gillibrand had a similar strategy. â€œMy game plan is to shake as many hands as I can,â€ the senator shared. But Gillibrand had a secret weapon – candy. She emphasized that handing out candy to children â€œis the solution for a strong parade performance.â€ Klobuchar touted that â€œI'm really good at running back and forth. We have done so many parades in our family because I started out in county office and we had 28 parades and I did nearly every single one of them.â€ She said that her daughter â€œonce wrote her confirmation essay for church and the theme was 'when life gives you a parade, walk it.'â€ Klobuchar's parade philosophy  – â€œthe key is -who are you next to in a parade. You don't want to be next to a horse because there can be droppings on the floor. I was once next to a snake zoo. That was unfortunate. You don't to be next to a pig, as a politician, with pork and everything. So there's a lot of judgement calls you make about where you are in a parade.â€",0.0,0.768,0.232,0.6037,0.04,0.9,0.06,0.9608
July4th,FOX,2016,Douglas MacKinnon,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/cancel-july-fourth-heres-how-stop-left-rewriting-us-history,Cancel July Fourth? Here's how we stop the left from rewriting US history,"MSNBC, CNN, and more liberal media outlets have spent the last several years painting America as racist, portraying the American flag as a symbol of division, and more. While those of us who trulyrevere the 4th of Julyfor its historic and liberty-attaining meaning celebrate, the far left, determined to not only cancel it but also smear our founders and founding documents, are once again mobilizing. Truth be told, they never stop. Many of their attacks are overt. Calling for the cancellation of the 4th of July and the banning of parades. Sandblasting the names of our Founding Fathers off schools and universities and tearing down their statues. Converting the homes ofThomas Jefferson (Monticello)and James Madison (Montpelier) into citadels of ""wokeness."" Smearing our founders with pejoratives such as ""White supremacist."" Fireworks explode over the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on July 4, 2017.(Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images) But an increasing number of the assaults are insidiously covert. 'EXTREME PRIDE' IN AMERICA WANES TO NEAR RECORD-LOW NUMBER AHEAD OF FOURTH OF JULY One of the latest such covert attacks – as fortunately reported in The Carolina Journal – comes from the University of North Carolina, where officials and their government affairs team are working behind the scenes to stop college constitutional literacy legislation called the Reach Act. What is the Reach Act? If passed, the Reach Act would require all North Carolina public college students to take a three-credit class on American government, the U.S. Constitution, and other foundational American documents, including the Declaration of Independence and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Letter from Birmingham Jail. Former Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen wave to members of the audience after he delivered remarks June 10, 2023, in Greensboro, North Carolina.(Win McNamee/Getty Images) Who could be against that? Well, aside from the aforementioned UNC officials, how about700 liberal professorsfrom the school and counting. To his great credit, when formerVice President Mike Pencespoke at UNC, he strongly defended the Reach Act, but his voice was heard by almost no one outside that hall. One of the main reasons – as I have stressed before – is because over the course of the last several decades, the left and far left have gotten a chokehold on what I call the ""five major megaphones"" of our nation: the media, academia, entertainment, science and medicine. They not only control most of the narrative, but, as we have seen time and again, can and will shut down those who run counter to that far-left narrative. Including former vice presidents defending the teaching of our founding documents. Alarmingly, what is happening on the UNC campus is spreading like wildfire not only across our liberal and socialist dominated colleges and universities, but throughout our high schools and middle schools. JULY 4TH QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR FACTS ABOUT INDEPENDENCE DAY? Last year at this time, I authored ""The 56: Liberty Lessons from those who risked all to sign The Declaration of Independence."" The sole purpose of that book was not only to warn of thisMachiavellian cancellation processinstigated by activists and anarchists from the left, but also to outline how we can fight back to save our shared – and often sacred – American history. Make no mistake. The far left is winning. With each passing month, they succeed in further smearing our Founding Fathers while eradicating the history that documents their genius, courage and tremendous sacrifice as they worked as one to establish the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. Just weeks ago, the far-left mayor of Albany, New York, succeeded in removing the statue in front of City Hall of Maj. Gen. Philip Schuyler. Schuyler was not only a heroic commander during the Revolutionary War, but a member of the Continental Congress, a U.S. senator and the father-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. To the left, none of that matters. To them, he was a ""White supremacist"" who had to be dealt with. We are losing, but all is far from lost. Starting around 1772, our Founding Fathers created ""Committees of Correspondence"" to spread the word of the tyranny of the British crown. Handwritten letters traveled from town to town, county to county, colony to colony. Our Founding Fathers knew then what we should never forget now. That unless those bent on totalitarianism imprison us or take our lives, they cannot silence our voices. They cannot silenceâ€¦ us.

Fox News has confirmed the report and obtained images of both messages. It wasn't immediately clear who started the chain. The message goes on to state that police are told they cannot strike because of New York State's Taylor Law, formally known as the â€œPublic Employees' Fair Employment Act,â€ that bars public employees from doing so. â€œThe people and this city doesnt honor us why honor them,â€ the flier further states. â€œSo its easy to loot and riot without repercussions but its not easy to do our job because the city will hang us.â€ An NYPD spokesperson told Fox News any suggestion that the NYPD would not be available to do its job ""is false.""

(AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez) RUDY GIULIANI: NYC IS GOING BACK TO 'RIDICULOUS' LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICIES UNDER DE BLASIO Demonstrators worldwide took to streets to decry racism and protest police brutality, which has further strained the relationship between the police and the public. Over the last three months, the coronavirus crisis has dealt an estimated $9.5 billion blow to New York City's budget, leading some elected officials to peer closely at police department funding. That scrutiny only intensified as pandemic lockdowns gave way to protests spurred by Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis, with demonstrations in New York marred by looting and violent clashes between officers and demonstrators. Last Friday, city council leaders joined the city's elected fiscal watchdog and police reform advocates in calling for $1 billion in cuts to the nearly $6 billion police budget. Among the proposals: slashing overtime, trimming the approximately 36,000-officer force through attrition, and investing some of the savings in social services and communities impacted by police misconduct. The second message is topped with the heading â€œ#Blueflu,â€ and describes how the mainstream media and New York State government officials have painted police as the â€œbad guys.â€ NYPD COPS PULLED FROM DA OFFICES AFTER PROSECUTORS DECLINED TO CHARGE ARRESTED GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTERS: REPORT â€œPolice officers like you and me took an oath to protect strangers regardless of race, class or gender,â€ states one of the fliers. â€œToday we are vilified and must stand as one. Enclosed are instructions on how we will get our point across that we are necessary and must be valued.â€ The message, which was sent out Thursday morning, also describes how an officer should go about taking a sick day on July 4, 2020 – â€œthe date that we will make our voices heard.â€ If officers are initially denied their advance request for the day off, the message further encourages them to phone the NYPD's â€œsick desk,â€ or even go into work that day and request a â€œbusâ€ – a term used to refer to an ambulance – to pick them up, according to the message.

No one thought for a moment of taking a knee. On the contrary, the new citizens whoimmigrated herefrom a variety of countries – including Turkey, Ethiopia and El Salvador – were all proud to have worked so hard to become part of a nation that would provide them with a level of freedom and security unattainable in their home countries.

That's because I attended a similar ceremony two decades ago in New York, at which my wife became a citizen. There was not a dry eye in the room. But more importantly, there was not a smidgen of regret or disdain for what this country proudly represents and guarantees its citizens. It's important on this particular July Fourth – at a time of riotous protests and onerous COVID-19 lockdown rules – to spend a moment seeing the United States of America through the eyes of new citizens. With that in mind, I share with you a letter I wrote to friends in 1999, on the day of my wife's naturalization ceremony: ""It's easy to forget how fortunate we all are simply to have been born here. We should never take our extraordinary rights for granted. â€œEvery citizen should be required to spend one day a year at a swearing-in ceremony for new citizens. There's a special look on the faces of folks who've come from places where rights are temporary at best, subject to the whims and prejudice of a ruling elite, whose rights supersede those of the governed. â€œOn the day these folks become citizens, their face and demeanor changes. Beyond the joy and relief, there is a genuine pride that shines through – a pride in having gone through the citizenship process, and more profoundly realizing that their rights have been locked in as securely as those of any other citizen. â€œI saw that look on my wife's face today as she became a U.S. citizen.

Joe Biden's Fourth of July message focused on America's long history of racial injustice -- from slavery toGeorge Floyd's death-- as he called for Americans to strive to achieve the country's founding ideal of equality. Biden said America's history is no ""fairy tale"" as the country has never lived up to the words of the Declaration of Independence that  ""all men are created equal."" But the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee released a hopeful video that the country can turn the tide after ""more than 200 years of systemic racism."" PHOTOS: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOUNT RUSHMORE SPEECH KICKS OFF 4TH OF JULY CELEBRATIONS ""We have a chance now to give the marginalized, the demonized, the isolated [and] the oppressed a full share of the American Dream,"" Biden said in a new campaign video. ""We have the chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country."" Biden's acknowledgment of America's flawed history and the ""racism that has torn us apart"" comes a day afterPresident Trumpdelivered a defiant Mount Rushmore speech where he stood up to the ""cancel culture"" of racial justice activists and those who are trying to wipe out American history, tear down statues and defame heroes. TRUMP, IN FIERY MOUNT RUSHMORE ADDRESS, DECRIES RISE OF 'FAR-LEFT FASCISM,' CALLS ON AMERICANS TO RISE UP The president asserted that recentattackson the nation's monuments were symptoms of a ""left-wing cultural revolution"" that was threatening to ""overthrow the American Revolution."" While Trump has staked his Independence Day campaign message on a strong defense of American monuments --even deploying a special federal unitfor the July 4 weekend to protect statues from potential vandalism -- Biden has concentrated on reckoning with America's imperfections.

Two hundred forty six years ago today, the American experiment was born. In our birth certificate, the Declaration of Independence, our Founding Fathers spelled out the fundamental rights given to us all by our Creator. They envisioned a nation built on freedom and fairness. In the centuries that followed we often failed, but more often succeeded, in our journey toward a ""more perfect union."" The resilience embedded in the DNA of America is what has united generations of citizens—people of all backgrounds—to come together to make the founders' vision a reality. This is a country that allowed me, the son of a single mom who raised her two Black sons in the South, to become aU.S. Senatorrepresenting the home of the Civil War. Where else on Earth is that possible? JULY 4TH TRIVIA: WHO WERE THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE? But while we live in the most connected, fair, and scientifically advanced time in human history, it often feels as though we've never been more disconnected and divided over the core truths that form the foundation of our nation. America is the beacon on the hill. It is the great land of opportunity that made my story of limitless potential possible. In my April 2021 response toPresident Biden's Joint Address to CongressI said that America is not a racist country. What some people heard is that race is no longer an issue. The idea that there are no threads of racism in the fabric of this nation would be just as preposterous as the revisionist history pushed by those who want to rewrite our story for 1619, reframing it as oppressed versus oppressor. What I said and what people heard couldn't be further apart. I fear we have forgotten how to listen to one another, and as a result, what was oncethetruth has proliferated into everyone havingtheir owntruth. We have created an environment that tells us to pick sides, dig our heels in, and throw bombs. Don't listen, don't try to understand. Every day is a battle. There is no reprieve. FOX NEWS POLL: PRIDE IN US DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY I refuse to buy into the ""burn it all down"" mentality dominating our current culture and discourse. That isn't my story and that isn't the story of America. That's why I've written my soon-to-be-released book, ""America: A Redemption Story."" The thread of tragic and triumphant moments from my own family's history and my own life are woven into the tapestry of stories from both major and minor characters of our nation's history. The resulting picture is complex and, I pray, encouraging and inspiring to millions of people across this country in search of reasons to be hopeful for our future. JULY 4TH TRIVIA: WHO WERE THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE? My story, like the story of many Americans, is one of challenges and opportunities, and of pain turned into purpose. I look forward to sharing more details about my family, the stories of others, and how our lives have followed the redemptive arc of our nation.

July4th,FOX,2022,Clay Travis,https://www.foxnews.com/us/espn-hates-america-july-4th-loves-woke-columnist-arrested-choking-wife,"ESPN hates America on July 4th, loves woke columnist arrested for choking his wife","Fox Nation host Abby Hornacek reports on Boston's patriotic history and July 4th celebrations. It's July 4th, a day when Americans from all different backgrounds take a day to celebrate our good fortune to all live in the greatest country in the history of the world. Unless, that is,you work at ESPN,when July 4th represents an opportunity for you to trot out a woke albatross of a column on the front page of your site arguing that America is awful. I haven't been writing as much at Outkick of late because I'm working on a new book, but today's ESPN July 4th column was such a perfect distillation of everything wrong with sports in America — and ESPN in particular — that I couldn't resist sitting down and writing this column before I head out to the beach with my kids. Before I systematically destruct today's woke ESPN column, some background: this column was written by Howard Bryant, a man currently being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to opine on sports for ESPN, despite having no discernible talent whatsoever. That's fine, it's a testament to the greatness of American exceptionalism that no talent chumps like Bryant can make a boat load of money in sports media despite having no ability in writing, radio or TV. But while Bryant's fealty to woke politics is all too common at ESPN, Bryant is unique in one way: he's been previously arrested for assaulting his wife in public, in front of his six year old son no less, and also charged with assaulting a police officer who arrived to protect his wife, after he was observed choking her in public. Bryant, a black man married to a white woman he was accused of choking in public, initially offered as his defense that racism was to blame for his arrest before pleading the charges down to six months of probation. Nevertheless you'd think someone making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year despite (allegedly) choking his wife and attacking a police officer and pleading down the charges with six months probation, might be inclined to think America is an incredibly forgiving place. After all, does Disney employ that many (alleged) wife and police assaulters? Not to my knowledge. But, alas, despite the forgiving nature of a country that has made a woke imbecile like Bryant fairly wealthy compared to the average American, Bryant flails away impotently for thousands and thousands of words without ever managing to strike any target, before collapsing in a final spasm of incompetence. No city celebrates the 4th of July quite like Boston, Massachusetts.(Nicholas Pfosi for The Boston Globe via Getty Images) We will return to these facts in a moment. But first, let's begin at the top of ESPN.com. The tagline at the top of ESPN.com is ""Serving sports fans. Anytime. Anywhere."" That's not my tagline, that's their own. That's the reason they exist, their statement of purpose. As you read this systemic destruction of this woke garbage ESPN published on July 4th, I want you to ask yourself: how does this piece serve sports fans in any way? Okay, now to the column, which is titled: ""Baseball, barbecue and losing freedom this Fourth of July."" ON 4TH OF JULY, NPR SCRAPS DECLARATION READING TRADITION FOR 'EQUALITY' DISCUSSION The column was published at 6:55 am eastern on July 4th, meaning it was planned for weeks, maybe months, to be published as a feature piece on this particular day. It has likely been read by many editors at ESPN and refined to this jumbled mess. That is, as awful as this column is, it was probably, at one point or another, even worse. This is, in essence, a polished turd. The opening of the column is a meandering wistful reminiscence about July 4th's past, Bryant literally begins a paragraph arguing July 4th was the best day of the year in his childhood. ""July 4th was the best day of the year. Everything was centered on family. In some ways it was even better than Christmas because the entire family showed up — the Fourth was a de facto family reunion. The massive barbecue, the pool at one uncle's house, even though you nearly drowned in it not once, but twice. All the cousins. The older ones who brought the cherry bombs and bottle rockets, the younger ones like you who were content with a strip of firecrackers. The Boston fireworks displays at the Esplanade, or later, at Stephens Field in Plymouth. The touch football games. The math reminds you just how young everybody was. When you were 40, your boy was in preschool. When your mother turned 40, you were a freshman in college."" Since Bryant was born in 1968, this dates these best July 4th's ever as occurring in the 1970's and 1980's. For those who have even a rudimentary knowledge of history, Bryant's wistful recollections encompass Watergate, a president's resignation, the highest inflation since Biden under Jimmy Carter, and the landslide election of Ronald Reagan, twice. It also includes the Cold War with Russia and boycotts in both 1980 and 1984 of the Olympics by either the Soviet Union or the United States. My point in bringing all this up is simply to reflect that far from everything being perfect, the 1970's and the 1980's were filled with political tumult and difficulties as well. Yet America was great then in Bryant's mind. Bryant's nostalgic reveries of of July 4th's past even includes a 1983 holiday game between the Yankees and Red Sox, when he would have been 14 or 15 years old. Bryant believes that 1983 game, squarely in the middle of Ronald Reagan's presidency, was near perfection. Up to this point in the column, that is, for several hundred words, he's been fond of July 4th. Then, out of nowhere, he suddenly pivots to the present day and writes this: ""Last month, Major League Baseball and its partners again released Independence Day-themed baseball hats that each of the 30 teams will wear. This year's version features a flush of stars across the front against a blue and white backdrop, offset with a shaggy shock of red. The Toronto Blue Jays, located in a country that does not celebrate American independence, were also issued the caps — even though the Canadian flag does not contain stars nor the color blue. Public outrage prompted a redesign of the Toronto caps. Next is the USA-themed socks, the marketing, the freedom-inspired spikes, gloves, wristbands, the inevitable paeans to the armed forces. By now, we're all numb to the spectacle. At least publicly, the emphasis on the Fourth of July shifted from family to symbols years ago — Sept. 11 did that. Two decades of paid patriotism has made it ever harder to center the Fourth on reconnecting with your favorite aunts and uncles. No backyard barbecue and badminton game could compete with 20 years of military tributes and unquestioned nationalism. You think back to Righetti.Cosmetically, there was nothing about that July 4, 1983, that said patriotism. All Yankee Stadium said that day 39 years ago was baseball.Ninety-four degrees. Sox-Yankees. The Stadium looked as it did every other day. The crowd came because it was July 4, a Monday day game — a great day for baseball and family — and, along with Bat Day, the biggest giveaway day of the year: Yankee Cap Day.""(I added the italics here because it appears to be Bryant acknowledging sports were better before they went political, which is an irony he doubtless missed given the rest of this column.) This pivot is fascinating because Bryant is directly arguing that the 1970's and 1980's July 4th celebrations weren't about patriotism, that it was only after 9/11 that the 4th of July becamedraped in American symbolism and patriotism.This is, quite clearly, 100% wrong. The very reason the 1983 baseball game Bryant loved so much was being played in the afternoon at all on Monday July 4th was because it was July 4th. Crazily, Bryant is upset that American teams are celebrating America in red, white and blue uniforms and that Americans responded to a 9/11 attack on our nation by embracing patriotism more fervently than before. This is the beginning of the column becoming unhinged. Now I'm not an expert on 4th of July celebrations all over the country, but I did grow up in the 1980's and the 1990's, before 9/11 occurred, and everywhere I ever went on the 4th of July was a massive celebration. Everywhere. When I was in college in Washington, D.C. and hundreds of thousands of people packed the national mall to watch fireworks, it had nothing to do with 9/11 because it hadn't happened yet. Spectators watch the 45th annual Macy's 4th of July Fireworks display overlooking the Manhattan skyline at Gantry State Plaza in Long Island City on July 4th, 2021, in Queens.(Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) Put plainly, Bryant's pivot here from loving July 4th to hating it, and the rationale behind it, is a made up fiction. The 4th, thankfully, hasn't really changed for most Americans over the past several generations. What has changed, however, is the opinions of people like Howard Bryant, who have decided they hate America. Let's continue in the column. We've already had one incredibly awkward transition, now here comes another one: ""Grilling, baseball and fireworks, first replaced by symbols — and now by a country tearing itself completely apart. July 4, 2022, falls in the midst of devastation. It is Independence Day in America with independence under current and relentless assault. From Miranda rights to the environment, to the separation of church and state, to guns — so many guns — people are reeling. The U.S. Supreme Court has run a chain saw through what two generations of Americans had known to be the legal baselines of their lives. Tens of millions of women today do not feel freedom and certainly are not celebrating independence. The people who can become pregnant who feel celebratory toward the Court may do so from the victory of their position, but it nevertheless remains true that the power of choice — and the right to privacy — has been taken from all of them."" The first sentence in this paragraph isn't even a sentence. It's an awkwardly connected string of words that furthers a lie — symbols replaced the halcyon fourth of the author's memory — followed by straight politics. But, again, it isn't a sentence at all. It's a thought bridge to nothingness, vapidity disguised as depth. In particular this phrase: ""Tens of millions of women today do not feel freedom and certainly are not celebrating independence.The people who can become pregnantwho feel celebratory toward the Court may do so from the victory of their positionâ€¦"" The people who can become pregnant?! You mean women? Is ESPN's official position now that men can become pregnant? Do you think that anti-science belief is embraced by your average sports fan? Of course not. But it's indicative of the degree to which woke politics has infested sports. From here comes a long list of political grievances, with no rhyme or reason, centered on, what else, January 6th. If you're thinking to yourself, why do I care about some random dude's opinions of January 6th on a sports website, shut up and read, you deplorable insurrectionist! ""YOU WATCH TV, even though you swore to not pay attention to the Jan. 6 congressional hearings. It was not a decision made from the perch of elegant privilege, of too rich to care, but from a full dissidence — a weariness of the gaslighting and false equivalencies, the whataboutisms, the goalposts moving that have defined the past several years. The spectacle of all-white juries acquitting proud, admittedly guilty white killers of Black people largely predated your birth, and thus for the past 18 months you've held on to a truth: The events of Jan. 6, where Americans stormed the most symbolically important legislative building in the free world — and a sitting president reportedly enraged he was not taken to the Capitol to join them — are the most unforgivable betrayals of the American ideal in your lifetime. You said you were not going to watch, but inner conflicts aside, you are an American — so you watch. You revisit the images of police barricades being knocked down, of Americans climbing through windows trying to breach the U.S. Capitol, of elected American officials sheltering in place and of police running from Americans lest they be trampled by them. Think about the people chasing them, the ones over past decades who always told your people to obey, the ones so quick to call others anti-American. You tell yourself to not think about the utter, enraging hypocrisy, to resist the useless and flaccid equivalencies. (Imagine if Black people did thatâ€¦) It all falls flat. We are post-hypocrisy. The equivalencies don't hold up. They never did."" The January 6thtakes eventually, and awkwardly intersect with sports takes, but not before Bryant lies and says cops were killed on January 6th. This feels like an intentional error, since as I said above, many people likely edited this piece for weeks before it was published.""When the barricades were overrun, and elected officials of both parties hid under their desks,and the cops were killed, and the very people who told Black people to respect the law and obey did not obey, where was La Russa? Where was Tortorella, who believed so much in America? Where was Esiason, and Ray Lewis and all the commentators who demanded law and order and respect?"" Again, there were no cops killed on January 6th. The only person killed on January 6th was Ashley Babbitt, an unarmed veteran, who was shot and killed by a police officer. On to Jack Del Rio from here, of course. ""One man who wasn't silent was Washington Commanders defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio, who lit the gas lamp — and dismissed Jan. 6. He called it a ""dust-up."" There was the outrage. Internally. On Twitter. But you get it. If the past several years have reinforced anything, it is that there has always been a separate set of rules, a concierge lane, a front door exclusively for white America. Jan. 6 crystalized this truth."" Bryant is a black guy who was arrested for assaulting a police officer and currently works for Disney owned ESPN, where he makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to tell us how awful America is. On Independence Day, no less. If anyone benefited from a ""separate set of rules, a concierge lane,"" it was him. Can you argue white people are privileged when you, a black guy, were arrested for assaulting a police officer — who arrived after a witness said you were choking your wife — and accepted six months of probation, which is far less of a punishment than most white people who participated in January 6th are receiving? Does Disney employ anyone arrested on January 6th? Hell, does any major media company in America? And yet Bryant lectures us about privilege? He's one of the most privileged people in all of American media. Next we getrandom Roe v. Wade takesfrom a guy arrested for allegedly choking his wife in public. ""Some prominent male athletes offered public support, as did the social media accounts of some teams, but you think about the players, the teams, the games, and all of the performative nature of support. Just the word support is incorrect, for it suggests the abortion option did not affect men, was not their fight. You think of the hideous mendacity of it all, that Roe saved the futures of as many men as it did women. Careers continued. Dreams were not derailed. Privacies were maintained. You think about the enormous gap between the fashionable statements, where the adversaries profit by saying the right things, and the actually committed people who will march and support and do the work. And while you contemplate another example of gaslighting in this country, it reminds you of USA Today columnist Nancy Armour's piercing question the day Dobbs replaced Roe: Where are all the girl dads?"" Ah, yes, just what we needed, a man arrested for assaulting his own wife standing up for women's rights. I have an idea for all men, how about we listen to the opinions of men who haven't been arrested for hitting women first when it comes to abortion? We can get to the opinions of arrested domestic abusers a few years from now. Or maybe never. But we're not done with Bryant's privileged takes. Then comes the requisite covid takes that every good wokie must share. ""You think about the pandemic, when so many of the girl dads, in the clubhouse, the press boxes and in the stands, gaslit their girls by stealing their language because they did not want to wear a mask or be vaccinated. ""My body, my choice,"" they would insultingly say. The term of empowerment that belonged to the pro-choice movement for a half-century became a rallying cry for people who could not bear the horrors of wearing a mask."" Yes, how dare people in sports not be willing to take a covid shot that offered them virtually no additional protection or wear a mask, which has been shown to be worthless at stopping covid? How dare they think for themselves and look at the data. Next comes a truly unhinged paragraph, which is really saying something given what Bryant has already written. ""There are two rules in the United States, never directly articulated but rife with consequence when broken: Beyond what the mainstream, which is to say white America, determines to be acceptable, it is forbidden to express humanitarian compassion and concern for the people of Palestine — just ask Dwight Howard. And it is unacceptable to unequivocally advocate for Black people. The former is in general violation of the nation's foreign policy, the latter is universally understood to be career threatening for the simple fact that any Black athlete that stands up for his people is routinely referred to as ""brave."" This first ""rule,"" ""it is forbidden to express humanitarian compassion and concern for the people of Palestine,"" is barely disguised anti-Semitism. People express support for Palestine all the time. Huge parts of the Democratic party, in fact, now make it one of their baseline beliefs. And this is certainly not a big issue to most Americans, who spend little to no time thinking about Israel or Palestine on a regular basis. Certainly it's not a political belief that is so unacceptable to have that it's unacceptable to say. Again, this is thinly veiled anti-Semitism, published on ESPN, with nary an editor's change? Yikes. As for the second rule, it is ""unacceptable to unequivocally advocate for Black people."" Are you kidding me? We had an entire NBA season played with ""Black Lives Matter"" emblazoned on the court. Player names on uniforms were replaced with social justice slogans, every major brand in America fell all over itself to donate as much money as possible to BLM causes. Colin Kaepernick has like 18 different documentaries he's being paid for, including an entire production deal with ESPN. Far from suffering economically, no one in the history of American sports has made more off of racial grievance theater than Kaepernick. And, lest we forget, ESPN is paying Bryant hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to write this crap attempting to unequivocally advocate for black people. (He's failing, but they're still paying him for it.) What Bryant is arguing here isn't brave or bold, it's the mainstream sports media opinion, that's why it's being published on ESPN in the first place. From this point forward, the article is all left wing political grievance and victim culture. That's fine, his self-defeating woke arguments are his own, but what's important here is they are also ESPN's own opinions. Even if you feel Bryant's rambling screed serves ESPN's stated goal of ""Serving sports fans. Any time. Anywhere,"" what's important to recognize is an opinion arguing the exact opposite of this column would never be permitted or published anywhere at ESPN. ESPN wouldn't allow any columnist to publish a piece saying this is the greatest July 4th in American history because the Supreme Court has protected unborn children and gun rights. If any editor even pitched this idea, he or she would be fired. And no columnist with this opinion would be permitted to be published. That's despite the fact that many of the people consuming ESPN's content daily — and employed at ESPN itself — believe in both of these things. In the past several months ESPN had a moment of silence ON AIR during the women's NCAA tournament to protest a Florida state bill that bans the teaching of sex related issues to kindergarteners, first and second graders. Opinion polls have shown that substantial majorities of white, black, Asian and Hispanic people agree with this bill. Yet ESPN stopped game programming to have a moment of silence. JULY 4TH PHOTO FEATURE: THESE PICTURES OVER THE YEARS HONOR AND CELEBRATE AMERICA'S INDEPENDENCE Last week ESPN stopped coverage of the NBA Draft to feature an on air talent lecturing the country, while she was nearly in tears, about the Roe v. Wade decision. These were on air ESPN broadcasts, not outside statements of opinion offered by ""talent."" These were ESPN endorsed and ESPN produced content segments distributed with their backing. The 43rd Annual Macy's 4th of July fireworks on July 4, 2019, in New York City.(Gotham/WireImage)) Just this week an ESPN talent taped herself inside of ESPN studios arguing dads should fight to ensure their daughters can have abortions in all fifty states. Imagine the reaction if an ESPN employee taped herself inside of ESPN arguing that all fifty states need to ban abortion. That talent would be immediately fired. On the spot, no questions asked. Not one ESPN opinion piece argued sports needed to overcome covid and find a way to play. Not one ESPN opinion piece in over two years has argued covid testing athletes makes no sense or that athletes should have the freedom to decide whether or not to get the covid shot. That's because ESPN won't allow these opinions to air on its network, radio shows, or websites. And unlike many of the political opinions Bryant addresses here, covid directly impacted sports in a massive way. And it's not just that ESPN refuses to share these opinions at all in its own content, it's that it punishes anyone who shares these opinions outside of ESPN's content walls. In fact, according to her lawsuit ESPN suspended Sage Steele for merely expressing her opinion that covid vaccine mandates were wrong on a outside ESPN podcast hosted by Jay Cutler. (Steele is currently suing ESPN for this disparate treatment.) ESPN also previously fired Curt Schilling for opposing transgender people being able to use the bathrooms of their choice. Each of these opinions weren't uttered on air, they were made in the private lives of these employees. So ESPN's position is its conservative talent doesn't even have the freedom to express their opinions off air, but its far left wing talent can use the network's own broadcasts to share their opinions. ESPN is so monolithic in thought that it not only publishes and features far left wing opinions on its platform, while policing what talent with conservative or mainstream beliefs say off air. Plainly, this is the actual issue as we all gather to celebrate July 4th, not that America is a horrible place filled with awful people and their scary ideas, but that many of our most powerful media outlets have abandoned content neutrality and the marketplace of ideas.We need more free speech, not less. ESPN published this awful, pathetic and racist piece by Howard Bryant, alleged wife beater and police assaulter, but it wouldn't publish the same type of opinion piece from Sage Steele. Indeed, worse than that, it wouldn't even let Steele share her own outside of work. The fact that ESPN, and most of the mainstream media outlets in our country, would make the same decision is the true tragedy of July 4th. And the fact that Outkick is the only sports media site in the entire country that would even publish a piece like this, is why we are thriving and 2022 will be our best year ever. But for now, I'm headed off to the beach with my kids to celebrate the fourth with them.

Medal of Honor recipient Leroy Petry weighs in. President Trumpis gearing up for his military-themed celebration onJuly Fourth, but the fireworks already are erupting as critics complain about the nature and cost of the event -- and authorities worry about possible violent clashes between leftist and right-wing protesters. Anti-war Code Pink members began arriving at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday, saying in a press release they intended ""to protest the militarization of July 4"" and hold an ""anti-imperialist festival"" Thursday on the National Mall. They were looking to float a â€œBaby Trumpâ€ balloon -- versions of which have been flown at protests in London -- blocks away from the national celebration. The National Park Service denied their initial request to fly the blimp, but Code Pink filed additional paperwork in a last-ditch bid to see the inflated caricature of the president take float. The bid was rejected. â€œWe are not allowed to fly the baby just keep him on the ground,â€ a Code Pink official said. TANKS ARRIVE IN D.C. AS TRUMP CONFIRMS JULY FOURTH CELEBRATION WILL FEATURE MILITARY DISPLAY But other left-wing activists organized by All Out D.C. are set to mobilize on Saturday in response to a planned rally by self-described â€œWestern chauvinistâ€ group the Proud Boys. U.S. Park Police, which covers the National Mall, is on alert, according to theWashington Post. ""We'll have people in different locations and watching,"" spokesperson Sgt. Eduardo Delgado told the Post. ""We prepare for the worst and hope for the best.""

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) The worst could be a repeat of what happened in Portland, Ore., last weekend, when Antifa members attacked conservative demonstrators including the Proud Boys. PORTLAND POLICE RELEASE PHOTOS OF SUSPECTS IN VIOLENT ANTIFA CLASHES THAT INJURED CONSERVATIVE WRITER Portland police said on Monday that a number people in the crowd concealed and brandished weapons, including ""batons, projectiles, and firearms."" A total of eight people were treated by medics, including three police officers, and three people were hospitalized, officials said. One of the All Out D.C. organizers said no one on their side is looking to start a fight, but they will be ready for one. ""No one in Antifa or Black Lives Matter or any of the different affinity groups are looking to instigate something. We are looking to uplift and protect our community as one,"" Carlos ChavarrÃ­a told the Post. ""But we are prepared for them to try to start a fight with us, to come to our action and try to instigate something."" Trump's plans for Thursday, meanwhile, have drawn complaints over the potentially garish military display and the accompanying cost. ""There's going to be a big price tag for this and the taxpayers will have to pick up the tab,"" Senate Appropriations Committee member Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said, according toNPR. The exact cost of the event is unknown, but the Pentagon is sending a B-2 bomber for a flyover at a rate of $122,311 an hour. That's in addition to Navy F-35 and F-18 fighter jets, Army and Coast Guard helicopters, and Marine V-22 Ospreys. On top of that is an aerial show by the Navy's Blue Angels and appearances by Army Abrams tanks. A U.S. official told Fox News that two tanks will be moved late Wednesday under the cover of darkness to the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial. Trump, who plans to break with tradition and speak at the festivities on Thursday, continues to defend the planning -- and downplay the costs. ""The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth,"" Trump said in a Wednesday morning tweet. ""We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door (Andrews), all we need is the fuel."" He said the fireworks that will be part of the celebration were donated. According to multiple reports, however, the National Park Service is diverting almost$2.5 millionfor the occasion. Trump's insistence on speaking at the event drew additional criticism. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., has described Trump's July Fourth celebration as â€œa political rally.â€ Fox News' Travis Fedschun, David McAlpine, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.126,0.728,0.146,0.0772,0.116,0.819,0.065,-0.9934

President Trump will go forward with plans to deliver an address to the nation during Washington D.C.'s annual July 4th celebration as part of a ceremony complete with military demonstrations and flyovers. The Interior Department on Wednesday revealed the plans after months of deliberations and controversy about how exactly the president planned to put his mark on the traditional capital celebrations. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt announced the details of the Independence Day celebration, which the administration has dubbed ""Salute to America."" DEMS FUME AS TRUMP MOVES TO AMEND DC'S JULY 4 CELEBRATION â€œThere is no more appropriate place to celebrate the anniversary of American independence than among the Nation's monuments on the National Mall and the memorials to the service men and women who have defended the United States for the past 243 years,â€ Bernhardt said in a statement Wednesday. â€œFor the first time in many years, the World War II Memorial and areas around the Reflecting Pool will be open for the public to enjoy a stunning fireworks display and an address by our Commander-in-Chief.â€ He added: â€œWe are excited to open these new areas so that more visitors may experience this year's Independence Day celebration in our nation's capital.â€ According to the Department of the Interior, the National Independence Day Parade will begin in the morning and last through the early afternoon on July 4—fully-equipped with marching bands, drum corps, military units, giant balloons, drill teams and more. In the early evening, around 6:30 p.m., Trump's â€œSalute to Americaâ€ celebration will begin. The event is slated to be a â€œcelebration of America's military with music, military demonstrations and flyovers.â€ Air Force One is scheduled to fly over the National Mall and U.S. military planes are expected to take part as well. As part of the celebration, the president is slated to address the nation from the Lincoln Memorial—a move that has prompted criticism from Democrats. â€œPresident Trump's efforts to insert politics into a celebration of our nation's history is extremely alarming,â€ House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said in a statement earlier this month. â€œForcing taxpayers to foot the bill for what amounts to a political rally is irresponsible and a misuse of funds. I strongly urge the president to reconsider his proposed event.â€ Hoyer is among several House Democrats who wrote a letter to Trump on June 6 asking him to abandon his plans, saying they worry it will â€œcreate the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally on the Mall at public expense.â€ In asking the president to reconsider, Democrats accused him of wanting to make the event about himself. Meanwhile, the administration will also co-sponsor a concert on the West Lawn of the Capitol which will feature the National Symphony Orchestra. TRUMP UNVEILS NEW RED, WHITE AND BLUE AIR FORCE ONE PAINT JOB Later, the â€œspectacular fireworks displayâ€ will commence over the National Mall. The fireworks will be launched from West Potomac Park and behind the Lincoln Memorial, and are expected to be visible from locations throughout Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia. Trump teased the celebration on Tuesday, during the launch of his 2020 re-election campaign rally. â€œBy the way, on July 4th in Washington D.C., come on down! We're going to have a big day!â€ Trump said. â€œWe're going to have hundreds of thousands of people!â€ Trump has been hinting at a new Independence Day celebration for months, tweeting in February: â€œHOLD THE DATE! We will be having one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington, D.C., on July 4th. It will be called 'A Salute to America' and will be held at the Lincoln Memorial. Major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me!â€ But the new plans have raised some logistical concerns with city officials. â€œWe have a lot of people come to the Fourth of July. Logistically, over the years, the kinks have been worked out,â€ D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser toldthe Washington Postlast month.  â€œWe don't want to throw off what already works.â€ The move to amend the July 4 celebrations in Washington comes after Trump floated the possibility of holding a military parade, an idea he got when he attended Bastille Day celebrations in France. But themilitary paradeidea was dropped after senior White House and Pentagon leaders estimated it would cost $92 million. â€œWhen asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled[sic] it. Never let someone hold you up!â€ Trump tweeted last year. Fox News' Lukas Mikelionis, Lucas Tomlinson and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.029,0.938,0.034,0.5919

The crowds danced to a military band playing popular songs and whooped when President Joe Biden took the podium to speak. The Washington Nationals' four presidential mascots — George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt — ran a footrace with Teddy winning. Yet there was an undeniable sense of loss for participants such as Twanda Taylor, a New Jersey kindergarten teacher. She brought her godson, Nasir Dickerson, 14, who lost his father to COVID-19 on April 21, 2020. â€œThis is what it's all about — bringing America all back together,â€ Taylor said. â€œIt's an honor to be here.â€ MORE ON THE FOURTH OF JULY: - After a year lost to the coronavirus,New York City's most well-known Fourth of July traditionsare back. - President Joe Biden is ready to host the largest event yet of his presidency, an Independence Day barbecue and fireworks-watching celebration on the South Lawn on Sunday night. -Fireworks were unintentionally detonatedas they were being set up for an Independence Day show in Ocean City, Maryland, leaving employees of the fireworks company with minor injuries. HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: 5:40 p.m. NEW ORLEANS — Fireworks are returning to New Orleans on Independence Day thanks to actor Will Smith. Smith is picking up the roughly $100,000 tab for the pyrotechnics over the Mississippi River after learning New Orleans didn't plan a 2021 show, city officials told news outlets. New Orleans cancelled last year's fireworks because of COVID-19. Smith is in New Orleans working on his latest film â€œEmancipation,â€ which will tell the story of a slave, Peter, who escaped a Louisiana plantation and whose photo of scars on his back from being whipped exposed the brutality of slavery. He would also fight for the Union in the Civil War. Smith moved production of the film from Georgia to Louisiana in early April after Georgia passed a new voting law that prompted a federal lawsuit saying the overhaul was intended to deny Black voters equal access to the ballot. 2:10 p.m. NEW YORK — Chowdown champ Joey â€œJawsâ€ Chestnut broke his own record to gulp to a 14th win in the men's Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Sunday. Michelle Lesco took the women's title. Chestnut downed 76 franks and buns in 10 minutes. That's one more than he did in setting the men's record last year, when the contest unfolded without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic. Lesco downed 30 ¾ dogs in 10 minutes. Reigning women's champ and record-holder Miki Sudo skipped this year because she's expecting a baby in a few weeks. 2 p.m. MIAMI — The Fourth of July holiday was marked with somber tones in South Florida, where a collapsed building has left at least 24 dead and more than 120 missing under rubble. â€œJuly 4 is ordinarily a time to gather with our loved ones and to celebrate our freedom and our independence, and this year the holiday looks very different,â€ said Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. â€œBut through this grief,â€ she said, â€œand all of the other obstacles that have been thrown our way, a clear picture emerges of what it means to be American.â€ A candle-light vigil was planned for Sunday night in Miami Beach for the victims of the fallen Champlain Towers South condominiums complex in Surfside, Florida. Neighboring Miami Beach typically hosts one of the region's most spectacular fireworks displays, but officials canceled its show for the second year out of respect for the families. The show could not go on last year because of the coronavirus outbreak. While many communities across South Florida canceled fireworks, one of the few locations in Miami-Dade County that was going forward with fireworks displays was former President Donald Trump's golf resort in Doral. Tickets for the free event, 20 miles (32 kilometers) inland from Surfside, were sold out.",0.0,0.565,0.435,0.6597,0.052,0.882,0.066,0.918

At the beginning, it was an afterthought","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — In the bedroom of the Betsy Ross House, a reconstruction of where the upholsterer worked on her most famous commission, a long flag with a circle of 13 stars hangs over a Chippendale side chair and extends across the floor. Over the weeks in 1776 needed to complete the project, Ross would have likely knelt on the flag, stood on it and treated it more like an everyday banner — not with the kind of reverence we'd expect today. â€œShe would not have worried about it touching the floor or violating any codes,â€ says Lisa Moulder, director of the Ross House. â€œThe flag did not have any kind of special symbolism.â€ Flags proliferate every July 4. But unlike the right to assemble or trial by jury, their role was not prescribed by the founders. They would have been rare during early Independence Day celebrations. Only in the mid-19th century does the U.S. flag become a permanent fixture at the White House, scholars believe; only in the mid-20th century was a federal code established for how it should be handled and displayed; only in the 1960s did Congress pass a law making it illegal to â€œknowinglyâ€ cast â€œcontemptâ€ on the flag. The flag's evolution into sacred national symbol, and the ongoing debates around it that inspire so much passion and anger, reflect the current events of a given moment and the country's transformation from a loose confederation of states into a global superpower. â€œThe flag was really an afterthought,â€ says Scot Guenter, author of â€œThe American Flag, 1777-1924â€ and a professor emeritus of American Studies at San Jose State University. In the beginning, Guenter says, the Continental Congress was more concerned about developing a â€œGreat Sealâ€ because it was needed for papers it would issue. Congress passed its first flag act on June 14, 1777: â€œResolved, that the Flag of the thirteen United States shall be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars, white on a blue field, representing a new constellation.â€ But the flag is otherwise peripheral to the country's beginnings. A spokesman for Independence Hall in Philadelphia says no records exist of a U.S. flag being present for the signing of the Constitution in 1787, or any indications that a national flag would have flown during the following decade at what is now called Congress Hall — a decade when Philadelphia was the country's capital. Researchers at George Washington's home have no evidence that the flag was displayed there in his lifetime. (Volunteers there now regularly raise and lower U.S. flags, which are sold at the gift shop as having â€œflown over Mount Vernonâ€). According to the White House Historical Association, no precise date exists for when the flag first had a permanent home at the presidential residence. Researchers at the historical association say the best guess is June 29, 1861, early in the Civil War, when President Lincoln dedicated a flagpole on the South Grounds. The Civil War, followed by the country's centennial in 1876, helped mythologize the flag. Americans were in the mood for a good story, and William J. Canby, grandson of Betsy Ross, had one. In a speech given to the Pennsylvania Historical Society, Canby drew upon family memories in narrating the quiet, heroic tale of Betsy Ross, who had died little known beyond her immediate community. â€œAs an example of industry, energy and perseverance, and of humble reliance upon providence, though all the trials, which were not few, of her eventful life, the name of Elizabeth Claypoole (her married name at the time of her death) is worthy of being placed on record for the benefit of those who should be similarly circumstanced,â€ Canby stated. The Ross House bills itself as â€œthe birthplace of the American Flag,â€ but its origins are uncertain. We have no definitive account. Many credit Francis Hopkinson, a congressman from New Jersey, but others, including Ross, may have added details — and, unlike the Declaration of Independence, we have no original artifact. Whether Ross or another produced the first one, its ultimate destination is unknown. â€œWe think it would have ended up on a ship mast, to signify that it was an American ship,â€ Moulder says. Ross' place in history also remains in question, even among government institutions. An essay entitled â€œThe Legend of Betsy Ross,â€ on the website for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum, says her tale is â€œshrouded in as much legend as fact,â€ with no substantial evidence of her involvement. Says the museum: â€œWhile it makes for a nice story, sadly, it is most likely false.â€ Ross, who died in 1836, left behind no diary or contemporary accounts of her whereabouts, officials at the Ross House acknowledge. But she was very much a real person who produced various flags before and after the alleged time she was approached by a commission that included George Washington and asked to sew a flag to represent the new country. Officials at the Ross house have no direct proof of Washington contacting Ross in 1776, but they note that a ledger unearthed in 2015 revealed Washington had engaged in business two years earlier with Ross and her husband and fellow upholster, John Ross. â€œWe know that Washington wanted the Rosses to make bedrooms curtains for his home in Mount Vernon,â€ Moulder says. â€œAnd curtains are the kind of job that Betsy would have taken on.â€ As the country grew more nationalized and nationalistic, Ross was added to the early pantheon and the flag's presence expanded like so much territory across the continent — into state ceremonies and buildings, sporting events, schools and private homes. In the midst of fierce labor battles and rising fears of immigration, the minister Francis Bellamy composed the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892. It was tied to the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing but also, as historian Richard White has written, addressed â€œa time of intense social conflict in an increasingly diverse nationâ€ and was intended â€as a hopeful affirmation of America's future.â€ Throughout the 20th century, regulations were proposed and enacted. The first national flag code was drafted in 1923 and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, with recommendations on everything from how to salute the flag to how to carry it. In the mid-1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower endorsed legislation adding â€œunder Godâ€ to the Pledge of Allegiance, a Cold War action with origins 20 years earlier. â€œIn the 1930s, you had conservatives arguing that the New Deal represented slavery and that the counterpoint was freedom under God,â€ says Kevin M. Kruse, a professor of history at Princeton University whose books include â€œOne Nation Under God,â€ published in 2015. â€œSo there was a corporate-fueled drive against the regulatory state and it takes on religious tones. In the 1950s, that gets appropriated by the anti-communists.â€ Burning American flags dates back at least to the Civil War. But only in July 1968, in response to Vietnam War protesters, did Congress pass legislation making it illegal (the Supreme Court overturned the ban in 1989) and adding other restrictions against â€œpublicly mutilatingâ€ the flag. Three months later, the radical activist Abbie Hoffman was arrested for wearing a Stars and Stripes shirt, charges later dropped on appeal. â€œHe showed up in the shirt for a meeting of the House Committee on Un-American Activities,â€ says Mark Kurlansky, author of â€œ1968: The Year That Rocked the World,â€ a social history. â€œHe just thought it would be funny.â€ Last month, the Biden administration hosted a Pride Day gathering on the White House South Lawn and hung a Pride Progress flag between U.S. flags on the Truman balcony. Rep. Mike Collins, a Georgia Republican, denounced the prominence of an â€œalphabet cult battle flag.â€ Other Republicans alleged that Biden officials had broken federal regulations, which call for the American flag to be â€œat the center and at the highest pointâ€ when grouped with other flags. Defenders of Biden noted that a U.S. flag was flying above from atop the White House. â€œThe flag is so important because it helps define what we believe in. You have Democrats and Republicans trying to attach meaning to it,â€ Guenter says. â€œThe flag can intersect with issues of gender and race and sexuality. There's so much there to think about, and it reveals so much about who we are.â€",0.144,0.856,0.0,-0.4023,0.089,0.838,0.073,-0.9856
July4th,AP,2022,"Chris Megarian, Zeke Miller",https://apnews.com/article/abortion-inflation-biden-covid-politics-7d366e0e3ff52a58150254829a87df38,"From one July Fourth to the next, a steep slide for Biden","WASHINGTON (AP) — Last Fourth of July,President Joe Bidengathered hundreds of people outside the White House for an event that would have been unthinkable for many Americans the previous year. With the coronavirus in retreat, they ate hamburgers and watched fireworks over the National Mall. Although the pandemic wasn't over yet,Biden said, â€œwe're closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.â€ Across the country, indoor masking requirements were falling as the number of infections and deaths plummeted. Within weeks, even some of the president's allies privately admitted that the speech had been premature. Soon the administration would learn that the delta variant could be transmitted by people who had already been vaccinated. Masks went back on, then came polarizing vaccination mandates. The even-more-contagious omicron variant would arrive months later, infecting millions and causing chaos during the holiday season. â€œWe were hoping to be free of the virus, and the virus had a lot more in store for us,â€ said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The number of people in the United States who died from COVID-19 nearly doubled, from 605,000to more than 1 million, over the past year. That sunny speech one year ago marked a crossroads for Biden's presidency. The pandemic appeared to be waning, the economy was booming, inflation wasn't rising as quickly as today and public approval of his job performance was solid. As Biden approaches his second Fourth of July in the White House, his standing couldn't be more different. A series of miscalculations and unforeseen challenges have Biden struggling for footing as he faces a potentially damaging verdict from voters in the upcoming midterm elections. Even problems that weren't Biden's fault have been fuel for Republican efforts to retake control of Congress. The pandemic's resurgence was swiftly followed last summer by the debacle of theU.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, when theTaliban seized control of the countryfaster than the administration expected as the U.S.-backed regime collapsed. Then, negotiations over Biden's broader domestic agenda stalled,only to collapse altogether in December. The Russian invasion of Ukrainein late February causeda worldwide spike in gas prices, exacerbating inflation that reached a40-year high. Another blow came last month, when the Supreme Courtoverturned the constitutional right to abortionunder Roe v. Wade and curtailed the Environmental Protection Agency's ability toregulate greenhouse gas emissions. Suddenly a reactive president, Biden has been left trying to reclaim the initiative at every step, often with mixed results. The coronavirus is less of a threat than before and infections are far less likely to lead to death, butCongress is refusing to supply more moneyto deal with the pandemic. Hesigned new gun restrictions into lawafter massacres in New York and Texas, and he's leadinga reinvestment in European securityas the war in Ukraine enters its fifth month. But he has limited tools at his disposal to deal with other challenges, such asrising costsanderoding access to abortion. â€œPeople are grouchy,â€ said Lindsay Chervinsky, a presidential historian. The latest pollfrom The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that his approval rating remains at 39%, the lowest since taking office and a steep slide from 59%one year ago.Only 14% of Americans believe the country is headed in the right direction, down from 44%. Douglas Brinkley, another historian, said Biden suffered from a case of presidential hubris after a largely successful run in his first five months in office, which included an overseas trip to meet with allies excited about welcoming a friendly face back to the international scene. He compared Biden's Fourth of July speech last year to President George W. Bush's infamousâ€œMission Accomplishedâ€moment during the second Iraq War. â€œHe was trying to deliver good news but it didn't pan out for him,â€ Brinkley said. â€œSuddenly, Biden lost a lot of goodwill.â€ White House officials reject the comparison, noting that Biden warned about the â€œpowerfulâ€ delta variant in his 2021 speech. Chris Meagher, a spokesman, said deaths from the virus are at a record low now, reducing disruptions in workplaces and classrooms. â€œFighting inflation and lowering prices is the president's number one economic priority, and he's laser focused on doing everything he can to make sure the economy is working for the American people,â€ he said. â€œAnd we're in a strong position to transition from our historic jobs recovery to stable and steady growth. Because of the work we've done to bring the pandemic under control, COVID is not the disruptive factor it has been for so long.â€ The promise to competently address the COVID-19 pandemic is what helped put Biden in the Oval Office and send President Donald Trump to defeat. From the start of Biden's tenure, his public pronouncements were sober and cautious, wary of following his predecessor in predictions that went unfulfilled. The nation's vaccination program found its stride under Biden, and by April 19, 2021, all adults were eligible to be vaccinated. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, was an adviser to Biden's transition team. But as the Fourth of July approached last year, he was worried and felt that the administration wasn't heeding his warnings. â€œEveryone was in this position of wanting to believe it was over with, and not fully understanding or appreciating the potential of the variants,â€ he said. Even now, a full year later, Osterholm is reluctant to say what the future holds. â€œI want answers too,â€ he said. â€œBut I don't know what the variants are going to bring us. I don't know what human immunity is going to look like.â€ Biden said the virus â€œhas not been vanquishedâ€ in his Fourth of July speech, and he held another event two days later to talk about the delta variant. â€œIt seems to me that it should cause everybody to think twice,â€ he said as he appealed to people who had not yet been vaccinated. Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University, said there's more reason to be optimistic this year than last. Immunity from vaccines or previous infections is much more widespread, and antiviral treatments are effective at preventing hospitalization and death in vulnerable patients. â€œIt was premature to declare independence from COVID-19 last year,â€ she said. â€œBut this year the country is in a totally different place, and in a much better place.â€ But Wen said Biden might be wary, given how things went before. â€œThe administration is hesitant to make those proclamations now, when actually this is the time to do so,â€ she said. Biden's early strategy of underpromising and overdelivering on COVID-19 was part of a concerted strategy to rebuild the public's trust in government. The resurgence of the virus eroded some of that trust and diminished confidence in Biden's job performance. Rebuilding that has proved difficult, especially as the country faces challenges, some, frustratingly for Biden,outside of his control. â€œWe expect the president to be all powerful and be able to fix every problem,â€ said Chervinsky, the presidential historian. â€œIt's a completely unrealistic expectation and, frankly, a dangerous one.â€ President Bill Clinton stumbled through his first two years in office, then faced a wave of Republican victories in his first midterm elections.

The White House is expressing growing certainty that July Fourth will serve as a breakthrough moment in the nation's recovery, even though the U.S. is expected to fall short of its goal of having 70% of adults vaccinated by the holiday. Still, the pace of the nation's healing will be a stark contrast with the rest of the world struggling to vanquish the virus. The planned celebration will be the largest event of Biden's presidency and is designed to demonstrate the nation's victory over the virus as COVID-19 cases and deaths drop to levels not seen since the first days of the outbreak. The U.S. is seeing its highest rate of air travel since the pandemic began, and schools, businesses and restaurants are rapidly reopening. To celebrate the resumption of pre-pandemic life, Biden is looking to celebrate the July Fourth holiday as â€œa summer of freedom.â€ He plans to host first responders, essential workers and military service members and their families on the South Lawn of the White House for a cookout and to watch the fireworks over the National Mall. More than 1,000 guests are expected, officials said. The plan shows the dramatic shift in thinking since Biden cautiously held out hope just three months ago that people might be able to hold small cookouts by the Fourth. For most Americans, that reopening target was hit last month, by Memorial Day weekend, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people and state and local virus restrictions also eased. Now, officials say July Fourth will serve as an unofficial kickoff to a new phase in the U.S. pandemic response. The federal government is looking to turn the page on the domestic public health crisis and focus on an economic and civic revival at home and marshaling support for vaccinations around the globe. The White House is hoping to see similar Independence Day activities across the country, a year after the virus forced a mass cancellation of festivities. â€œWe welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honor our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the frontlines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,â€ the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials Tuesday. It asked them to share their own plans, which the administration would later highlight. â€œAmerica is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,â€ the administration wrote to officials. â€œA summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.â€ The upbeat announcement contrasts with the drearier reality in Europe, where Biden is on an eight-day tour, and in the rest of the world as vaccines remain scarce. â€œThe administration needs to walk a line, using events like this to increase vaccine interest and confidence here in the U.S. while also being sensitive to the fact that this crisis is still out of control in many parts of the world,â€ said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the Division of Health Policy and Public Health. For instance, in the United Kingdom, one of the few countries that has a vaccination rate similar to that of the U.S., the government announced Monday that it plans to further delay reopening for at least another month to try to get more people vaccinated and to slow the spread of the highly transmissible and more dangerous delta variant first identified in India. In large swaths of the world, the virus is raging unchecked, and health experts warn that without vaccinations, variants can emerge that will break through the protection the vaccines are providing in the U.S. While in Europe, Biden and other Group of Seven leaders announced plans to provide 1 billion shots for poorer nations, half of them from the U.S., but aid groups said a far greater commitment is needed to defeat the virus around the globe. Even in the U.S., as infection rates continue to slip, the vaccination campaign is far from over. Fewer than 370,000 Americans are now getting their first dose on average each day, down from a high of nearly 2 million per day two months ago. White House officials acknowledge the deep geographic disparities in vaccination rates and said the administration will continue to issue reminders that unvaccinated Americans remain at risk of serious illness and death from the virus. Yet cases are trending downward even in the Southern and Midwestern states that remain markedly behind the rest of the country in vaccinations. Elsewhere, California began its grand reopening Tuesday, lifting nearly all its remaining virus restrictions. In New York, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo said had hit a benchmark of 70% of adults receiving at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, rules were being lifted that had limited the size of gatherings and required some types of businesses to follow social distancing or cleaning protocols. â€œIt means that we can now return to life as we know it,â€ Cuomo said, announcing that the state would also launch fireworks Tuesday to mark the occasion, in addition to New York City's already announced plans to resume its July Fourth fireworks display on the East River. All American adults have been eligible for vaccine shots for two months, and the administration has mounted an aggressive â€œmonth of actionâ€ to try to drive up demand for doses, though that has done little to change the trend lines: Fewer Americans are interested in getting vaccinated. Officials say the effects of the July Fourth vaccination goal of 70% of Americans on driving down COVID-19 cases are already being felt even if the benchmark won't be attained. Some 166.5 million adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. To reach his goal, Biden would need to vaccinate about 14 million more people in less than three weeks. â€œRegardless of where we are on July Fourth, we're not shutting down shop,â€ White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. â€œOn July 5th, we're going to continue to press to vaccinate more people across the country.â€ Biden intends to use his remarks on July Fourth to highlight the administration's â€œwartime response,â€ with a vaccination campaign that helped bring cases and deaths down by about 90% from where they were before he took office on Jan. 20.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.043,0.891,0.066,0.9596

In Boston, people dodged raindrops to nab a coveted space on the grassy oval in front of the Hatch Shell along the Charles River ahead of the traditional Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular. Hundreds of thousands of partygoers typically line both sides of the river for the fireworks spectacular that follows a concert. At another longstanding celebration, fans of competitive eating crowded to watch Nathan's FamousFourth of July hot dog eatingcontest held in the Coney Island section of New York City. Heavy downpours interrupted the contest, but after the pause, Joey â€œJawsâ€ Chestnut swallowed 62 franks and buns in 10 minutes. â€œWhat a roller coaster, emotionally,â€ Chestnut said. The 39-year-old from Westfield, Indiana, first competed for the title in 2005 and hasn't lost since 2015. The unsettled weather moved on before the start of Macy's annual Fourth of July fireworks show, which launched some 60,000 pyrotechnics into the sky, bursting in bouquets of colorful light over New York City's East River. New York wasn't the only state where weather factored into events. The 10-kilometer Atlanta Journal-Constitution Peachtree Road Race that typically draws thousands of runners in humid summer weather was cut short because of possible thunderstorms. Farther north, a fireworks show in Yankton, South Dakota, was postponed until Wednesday night because lightning prevented crews from setting up the display. In Nebraska, the Omaha Symphony's Independence Day Celebration that includes a concert and fireworks shows were also postponed until Wednesday night. New Orleans residents welcomed rain and slightly cooler conditions after days of heat and humidity baked the city. The General Roy S. Kelley fireboat was returning to New Orleans Riverfront for a patriotic water show, sending streams of red, white, and blue water into the air. The Colorado towns and suburbs of Estes Park, Golden and Highlands Ranch cancelled fireworks celebrations after thunderstorm alerts were issued. Severe weather warnings scuttled Independence Day travel plans at Denver International Airport, where at least 290 flights were delayed and 171 cancelled -- among the most flights affected in the nation -- according to Flight Aware. President Joe Biden hosted a barbecue for military families at the White House, which was decked out with red, white and blue bunting and big U.S. flags draped over the columns facing the South Lawn. Biden told the crowd gathered how grateful he was for their service. And he talked about how important it was to work to unify the nation. â€œDemocracy is never guaranteed,â€ Biden said. â€œEvery generation must fight to maintain it.â€ Later, the Bidens watched fireworks from the White House balcony with thousands of guests on the lawn, as Louis Armstrong's version of â€œAmerica the Beautifulâ€ played over loudspeakers. Vice President Kamala Harris was in her home state of California, where she visited a Los Angeles fire station to pay tribute to first-responders who she said risk their lives for their community. â€œOn this Independence Day, we came by to thank them, and to let them know we think of them all the time,â€ Harris said. While the holiday put a spotlight on how Americans carrydifferent views of patriotism,many people embraced the holiday with whimsy and a sense of community. In Hannibal, Missouri, the hometown of Mark Twain, the Fourth of July weekend coincides with National Tom Sawyer Days. Fence-painting and frog-jumping contests were held. Altoona, Iowa, dubbed its celebration â€œCORNival.â€ In addition to the nod to America's birthday, the festival marks the 100th anniversary of the first acre of commercial hybrid seed corn, grown and harvested in Altoona in 1923. Twenty 6-foot-high fiberglass corn cob statutes decorated by local artists were being unveiled and will later be placed around the town of 21,000 residents. In Joppatowne, Maryland, hundreds of people lined up at a Sheetz gas station to pump regular fuel at $1.776 per gallon, WBAL-TV reported. Sheetz set the price per gallon in commemoration of the year the Declaration of Independence was signed, according to a statement posted on the company's website. And in the east Tennessee city of Gatlinburg held its annual Independence Day midnight parade early Tuesday. George Hawkins, who created the parade, died Saturday, news outlets reported. Running events were a feature of many celebrations. In Lexington, Kentucky, about 2,000 people ran through the city's downtown. Stephanie Thurman told WKYT-TV that the race had been on her bucket list. â€œI started these races here in 2019; I turned 50. That was one of the things on my bucket list, so I did that, and ever since then, I was bit by the bug,â€ Hundreds participated in Alaska's Mount Marathon, a grueling mountain race that features steep inclines, loose rock and shale that the top runners seemingly fly over on their way down. It's an Independence Day tradition in coastal Seward, a town of about 2,500 people south of Anchorage. Some cities were eschewing firework displays for shows in which drones fitted with lights are coded to create massive, moving shapes in the sky. Los Angeles, Tahoe City, California, Salt Lake City, and Boulder, along with a few other Colorado towns, have opted for the the aerial spectacles that can display an expansive American flag and the year 1776 in red, white and blue. Avoiding explosive fireworks limits the danger of fires in states already devastated by massive burns. The air pollution agency for Southern California issued an alert for potential health problems caused by high levels of airborne particles from fireworks. The particulate advisory by the South Coast Air Quality Management District is in effect through Wednesday in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. TheChicago suburb of Highland Park, where a shooting at least year's Fourth of July parade left seven people dead, also held a drone show to avoid the startling noise of fireworks. Gun violence also marred some of the celebratory atmosphere, as shootings leftfive dead in Philadelphiaandthree dead in Texas. Fireworks also led to at least one death,in western Michigan.Nine other people were injured in that fireworks explosion on Monday, the Ottawa County Sheriff's Department said.",0.0,0.608,0.392,0.7964,0.085,0.87,0.044,-0.9946

The Fourth of July historically is one of the nation's deadliest days of the year. Aflurry of shootingsaround the holiday a year ago left more than a dozen people dead and over 60 wounded. And a year before that, seven people died in amass shooting at a Fourth of July paradenear Chicago. Violence and mass shootings often increase in thesummer months, with more people gathering for social events, teens out of school and hotter temperatures. In Chicago alone, 11 people had been killed and 55 wounded in shootings as of Friday morning during the extended July Fourth weekend, theChicago Sun-Timesreported. The violence included a mass shooting on Thursday that killed two women and an 8-year-old boy. The recent violence â€œhas left our city in a state of grief,â€ Mayor Brandon Johnson said. A community rally was planned for Friday evening, and the city will beef up police presence over the weekend, Johnson said in a statement. â€œWe are devastated by the recent violence that has left our city in a state of grief and we extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and communities impacted by these recent events,â€ Johnson said. Eight people were wounded in Chicago's Little Italy neighborhood shortly after midnight Friday. About 90 minutes later, a shooting in the city's Austin neighborhood injured six. Police said preliminary findings suggest the separate shootings involved an exchange of gunfire between two people who then fled. Recent violence at a popular Lake Michigan beach in Chicago prompted officials to close it early each night through the holiday weekend as a precaution. The 31st Street Beach has been the scene of recent stabbings and shootings. In Huntington Beach, California, two people were killed and three others injuredin an Independence Day attackless than two hours after a fireworks show ended, police said. Authorities arrested a suspect after responding to reports of an assault with a deadly weapon Thursday night. In the northeastern Ohio community of Niles, Police Chief Jay Holland said a 15-year-old male was in custody after a 23-year-old man was fatally shot Thursday night at a Fourth of July party at a residence. A 10-year-old girl, identified as Gracie Griffin, was fatally shot in a Cleveland neighborhood, police said. It is not yet known what sparked the shooting or if she was targeted. A 19-year-old man was killed and six others were wounded in a drive-by shooting in Philadelphia on Thursday night. The wounded, which included four juveniles, were being treated at hospitals for various injuries that were not considered life-threatening. It is not known yet what prompted the shooting. Three shootings occurred in the Boston area following the city's Fourth of July celebrations, leaving one man dead. The fatal shooting occurred about 1:30 a.m. Friday in a park near Boston's South End neighborhood. At about the same time, three other people were wounded in the city's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. A third shooting at a gas station later left a victim with life-threatening injuries. A 17-year-old male suffered a stomach wound in another shooting Thursday night in a condominium parking lot in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts. In Connecticut, a woman was found shot in her car early Friday and was pronounced dead at a hospital. Police identified her as Shamyria Williams, 23, of Hartford. Relatives told reporters they believed she had just left a Fourth of July party. Police in Albany, New York, said six males ranging in age from 16 to 19 were being treated at a hospital for injuries that were not considered life-threatening after a shooting at a large gathering. Police responded to reports of a shooting at a home around 12:15 a.m. Friday. None of the victims were found at the scene but police said they located evidence consistent with gunfire in the yard behind the residence and in the street. One teenager who had been shot flagged down officers along a street a short time later, police said. Five teens were wounded when shots were fired into a crowd following a fight at a party early Friday morning in Pontiac, about 30 miles (48.2 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. Three of the victims are 14 years old. The other two are 15 years old. All are males. Authorities said they were taken to hospitals with wounds not considered to be life-threatening. Four people were wounded in a shooting early Friday outside a Tampa adult nightclub after an altercation between the club's security guard and two men, police said. The two men drove their car to the front of the Pink Pussycat Lounge and one of them shot the security guard with a handgun, police said. The security guard underwent surgery at a hospital and was in stable condition. Three other men suffered unspecified minor injuries. Police said both suspects were arrested and charged with several crimes. In the Queens section of New York, an 8-year-old boy was fatally stabbed in an apartment in what police described as a domestic dispute. Police said officers later fatally shot a 20-year-old man who held a knife to his 43-year-old father's throat and refused commands to drop the weapon. In High Point, North Carolina, a shooting at an unofficial fireworks display left one person dead after a large crowd had gathered in the parking lot of the city about 90 miles (145 kilometers) west of Raleigh, police said. The victim was identified as Keith S. Lynch, 32, of High Point. Shootings at two St. Louis-area Fourth of July gatherings left two men dead and five others injured, two critically, police said. In West Virginia, Charles Speer, 42, of Kermit, died early Friday after being shot multiple times following a physical altercation at the home of another man, state police said. And a road-rage incident led to the fatal shooting of a 36-year-old man in Taneytown, Maryland, according to the Carroll County Sheriff's Office. Earlier Thursday, a police officer serving a warrant in Cleveland and an armed person making threats in Yellowstone National Parkwere among those killed in other shootings.

In Washington, neon bursts of light illuminated the night above the National Mall. The Boston Pops performed a musical fireworks spectacular at that city's Hatch Memorial Shell. And at parades all across the country, from Brattleboro, Vermont, to Waco, Texas, to Alameda, California, revelers dressed up in red, white and blue and waved the Stars and Stripes in commemoration of Independence Day. Travel records were projected to fallwith people jamming airports and crowding highways to reach Fourth of July celebrations that will stretch into a long weekend for many. On the East Coast, some would-be beachgoers in Connecticut were turned away as parking at state parks filled to capacity, including a 2-mile (3 kilometer) stretch at Hammonasset Beach State Park, the state's largest shoreline beach. Across the West, meanwhile, residentsdealt with stifling heatas the National Weather Service warned of a â€œsignificant and extremely dangerousâ€ heat wave across much of the region. Some spots in the desert Southwest were expecting temperatures topping 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius), and hot, muggy conditions also permeated the Deep South and Middle Atlantic. A heat advisory in Philadelphia that came with temperatures tipping into the 90s didn't stop crowds from gathering at historic sites in the city where the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776. Outside the National Constitution Center, volunteer actors dressed in Revolutionary War-era costume made of heavy wool, despite the heat. Participants said it was worth it. â€œIt keeps you connected to your neighborhood and where you live,â€ said Adrian Mercado, who donned a 6th Pennsylvania Regiment uniform. Evening fireworks were scheduled over the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, after a concert by Ne-Yo and Kesha. In New York City, Macy's annual fireworks show fired off thousands of projectiles from the Hudson River, lighting up the skylines of Manhattan, Hoboken, and Jersey City. From Queens, bright golden and orange exploding orbs could be seen silhouetting the Empire State Building, itself lit up in red, white and blue. Mild weather brought residents to their rooftops, where many lit their own fireworks. â€œThis is how we celebrate. It's the bombs bursting in air. It's the rockets' red glare. That's how people show their pride and patriotism,â€ said Julie Heckman of the American Pyrotechnics Association. All signs pointed to big celebrations: The Transportation Security Administration reported that a record of nearly 3 million people traveled through airports in a single day last week, a figure expected to be broken this week. AAA projected that 60.6 million people will travel by car during the holiday period. Part of the boost was attributed to easing inflation, though many Americans remainconcerned about the economy. In suburban Chicago, Highland Park resumed its annual parade on the second anniversary of amass shooting that took seven livesandinjured dozens at the 2022 event. Residents gathered at a middle school for a remembrance before the parade, which followed a different route than in the past. â€œJuly Fourth is always going to be a day of mixed emotion,â€ Mayor Nancy Rotering said. â€œWe come forth today hoping we as a community can remember and honor the lives lost.â€ The holiday celebrating the establishment of a new country free from British rule is traditionally marked by barbecue, cold drinks and the Stars and Stripes on flagpoles and on clothing, in addition to the parades. But some were also celebrating in other ways unique to their communities. AP correspondent Rita Foley reports that millions of Americans are traveling for the July Fourth holiday. Of course there was theannual hot dog eating conteston New York's Coney Island, where a new champion chomper emerged: Patrick Bertoletti of Chicago gobbled down 58 hot dogs to win his first men's title. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo of Florida downed 51 links to notch her 10th title and set a new record. In Alaska, the city of Seward got a head start with a fireworks display at midnight, as thousands of people gathered on a rocky beach during the brief window when the sky dims this time of year in the land of the midnight sun. The shells burst over Resurrection Bay as people watched in silence. â€œIt was absolutely magical,â€ resident Iris Woolfolk said. The Northern California city of Oroville's annualfireworks were canceleddue to a wildfire, although most of the 17,000 people under evacuation orders or warnings were able to go home as hundreds of firefighters toiled underextreme heat. The July Fourth holiday generally unites Americans in their shared love of country, but the 2024 version comes against a backdrop of deeppolitical polarizationand a divisivepresidential race. In Boston, where tens of thousands were expected to enjoy the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular, conductor Keith Lockhart said it's inspiring to see people of different political stripes gather on Charles River Esplanade. But, he noted, â€œone would have to have one's head pretty deeply stuck in the sand to not notice the deep divisions in our country.â€ Associated Press writers John O'Connor in Springfield, Illinois; Isabella O'Malley in Philadelphia; Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut; and Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico, contributed to this report.",0.0,0.812,0.188,0.5719,0.018,0.902,0.08,0.995

LOUIS (AP) — The Fourth of July is Americana at its core: parades and cookouts and cold beer and, of course, fireworks. Those pyrotechnics also make it an especially dangerous holiday, typically resulting in more than 10,000 trips to the emergency room. Yet fireworks remain at the center of Independence Day, a holiday 247 years in the making. Here are five things to know about July Fourth, including the origin of the holiday and how fireworks became part of the tradition. The holiday celebrates the Second Continental Congress' unanimous adoption of theDeclaration of Independenceon July 4, 1776, a document announcing the colonies' separation from Great Britain. One year later, according to theLibrary of Congress, a spontaneous celebration in Philadelphia marked the anniversary of American independence. But across the burgeoning nation, observations didn't become commonplace until after the War of 1812. It quickly took off: The Library of Congress notes that major historic events in the 19th century, such as groundbreaking ceremonies for the Erie Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, were scheduled to coincide with Fourth of July festivities. The display of pyrotechnics has been a big part of Independence Day from the outset. Founding Father John Adams saw it coming. Commemoration of America's independence â€œought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,â€ Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776. Fireworks were around centuries before America became a nation. TheAmerican Pyrotechnics Associationsays many historians believe fireworks were first developed in the second century B.C. in ancient China by throwing bamboo stalks into fires, causing explosions as the hollow air pockets overheated. By the 15th century, fireworks were widely used for religious festivals and public entertainment in Europe and early U.S. settlers carried on those traditions, the association said. Presidents from George Washington to Joe Biden have celebrated the nation's birth on the Fourth of July, with one exception: Adams. His letter to his wife aside, Adams refused to celebrate the holiday on July 4 because he felt July 2 was the real Independence Day. Why? It was on July 2, 1776, that the Continental Congress voted in favor of the resolution for independence, though the Declaration of Independence wasn't formally adopted until two days later. Adams was so adamant that he turned down invitations to festivals and other events, even while serving as the nation's second president. Ironically, Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, both died on the 50th anniversary of the document's formal adoption, July 4, 1826. Consumer sales of fireworks have grown rapidly over the past two decades. Statistics from the American Pyrotechnics Association show that in 2000, American consumers spent $407 million on fireworks. By 2022, that figure rose to $2.3 billion. The biggest jump came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when public fireworks displays were shut down. Consumer sales jumped from $1 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020. â€œPeople went to the fireworks store beginning Memorial Day weekend and they just didn't stop,â€ said Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association. â€œThey were firing off fireworks all of 2020. It shocked the industry, to be quite honest with you.â€ Sales are expected to rise another $100 million this year, the association said. It helps that the Fourth of July is on a Tuesday, creating essentially a four-day weekend. Despite widespread education efforts, thousands of Americans are badly injured by fireworks each year, and this year is no exception. Late Saturday night, firefighters and medics were called to Lexington Township, a suburb of Kansas City, Kansas, for reports of a shed on fire and arrived to find fireworks actively exploding from the burning shed and several people lying injured on the ground. Firefighters, medics and local police dragged the victims from the area to safety, and four people were taken to hospitals — two with serious injuries, Northwest Consolidated Fire District Chief Todd Maxton said in a statement. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2022, 10,200 people were treated at emergency rooms and 11 deaths were blamed on fireworks. About three-quarters of injuries happened in the period around the Fourth of July. About one-third of the injuries were to the head, face, ears or eyes. Finger, hand and leg injuries are common, too. â€œI have seen people who have blown off fingers,â€ said Dr. Tiffany Osborn, an emergency room physician at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. â€œI've seen people who have lost eyes. I've seen people who have significant facial injuries.â€ Children under 15 make up nearly one-third of those injured by fireworks. Sparklers often are blamed for burns to children under age 5. Osborn suggested giving small children glow sticks or colorful streamers instead. For those planning to shoot off fireworks, Heckman urged finding a flat, hard, level surface away from structures and other things that could catch fire. The person responsible for the fireworks should avoid alcohol. Children should never ignite them. Osborn encouraged having a bucket or hose nearby in case of fire or explosion. Shoot off one at a time and walk away quickly after igniting, she said, and never relight or handle a malfunctioned firework. When done, shovel up the remains and soak them before disposing.",0.0,0.787,0.213,0.4019,0.094,0.824,0.082,-0.876

They've bailed to the beach, the mountains, the golf course, the farm, the ranch. In the middle of the Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt was sailing to Hawaii on a fishing and working vacation. It's also been a day for some presidents to insert themselves front and center in the fabric of it all. Teddy Roosevelt drew hundreds of thousands for his July Fourth oratory. John F. Kennedy commanded a huge crowd from Philadelphia's Independence Hall. In 2019,Donald Trump marshaled tanks,bombers and other war machinery for a celebration that typically avoids military muscle. Richard Nixon enraged the anti-war masses without even showing up. As the anti-Nixon demonstrations of 1970 showed, Independence Day in the capital isn't always just fun and games. It has a tradition of red, white and boo, too. In recent times, though, presidents have tended to stand back and let the people party. George W. Bush had a ceremony welcoming immigrants as new citizens. Barack Obama threw a South Lawn barbecue for troops. Bill Clinton went to the shores of Chesapeake Bay to watch a young bald eagle named Freedom be released to the wild. In 2021, Joe Biden gathered more than 1,000 people on the White House South Lawn to eat burgers and watch fireworks. That event was noteworthy becausesuch gatherings were unthinkablein the first year of the coronavirus pandemic. Many wished Biden had not thought of doing it even then — the rampage of the omicron COVID-19 variant was still to come.

After hours of parading troops, fireworks, bonfires and music, he tells her he strolled alone in the dark. â€œI was walking about the streets for a little fresh air and exercise,â€ he writes, â€œand was surprised to find the whole city lighting up their candles at the windows. I walked most of the evening, and I think it was the most splendid illumination I ever saw; a few surly houses were dark; but the lights were very universal. Considering the lateness of the design and the suddenness of the execution, I was amazed at the universal joy and alacrity that was discovered, and at the brilliancy and splendour of every part of this joyful exhibition.â€ 1791: Two years after becoming the first president, George Washington celebrates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, â€œwith an address, fine cuisine, and walking about town,â€ says the National Park Service.

July4th,CNN,2024,Elisabeth Buchwald,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/22/politics/fact-check-democratic-national-convention-night-four/index.html,Fact-checking night 4 of the Democratic National Convention,"The fourth and final night of the Democratic National Convention focused more on biography, big themes, subjective arguments and uncheckable promises and predictions rather thanfactualassertions. Here is a fact check of five claims Vice President Kamala Harris made in her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, plus one claim by a Democratic senator. In her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned the Supreme Court's July decision on presidential immunity while warning about the â€œconsequencesâ€ of giving former President Donald Trump another term. â€œConsider the power he will have – especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution,â€ Harris said. â€œJust imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.â€ Facts First:This needs context. The Supreme Courtrulinglast month did not grant Trump or former presidents in general total immunity from criminal prosecution, though it did grant them immunity for many of their activities in office. The court ruled that a former president has â€œabsolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authorityâ€ and is â€œentitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official actsâ€ – but also ruled that â€œthere is no immunity for unofficial acts.â€ It's fair for Harris to frame the ruling as anexpansion of presidential power. But the ruling did not kill the ongoing criminal prosecutions against Trump, let alone prohibit any future criminal prosecutions against him. A federal prosecution over Trump's attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 election isback in the hands of a district court judge, who must decide which of the alleged Trump acts at issue are official and which are unofficial. And a state-level election subversion prosecution against Trump is also alive in Georgia, though it ison holdamid a battle over whether the district attorney leading the case should be disqualified. In May, before the Supreme Court ruling, Trump wasfound guiltyof felony falsification of business records in a state-level prosecution in New York. The presiding judge isnow consideringhow the ruling applies to that case, in which Trump is awaiting sentencing. From CNN's Daniel Dale Harris said that if Trump were to become president again, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion; enact a nationwide abortion ban; force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions â€œwith or without Congressâ€; and create a national anti-abortion coordinator. â€œSimply put,â€ she said, â€œthey are out of their minds.â€ Facts First:Harris is making a prediction that we cannot definitively fact check, but Trump himself has not, during this campaign, endorsed these policies she said he would implement as president. Many of the policies are proposed in Project 2025, a conservative think tank's set of policy preferences for a next Republican administration. Over the past couple decades, Trump's position has shiftedseveral timeson abortion restrictions. On Truth SocialThursday, Trump wrote â€œI do not limit access to birth control or I.V.F. - THAT IS A LIE, these are all false stories that she's making up, that I've never even heard of. It's just words coming out of her mouth.â€ Trumpregularly boastsabout how he appointed the justices to the US Supreme Court that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed pregnant people the right to an abortion in the United States. Even in this latest campaign, Trump hasrepeatedly duckeddirect questions about his support for a federal ban, and polls show that the majority of Americans are not in favor of a federal abortion ban. Polls also show Republicans and Democratslargely believethat access to birth control should be widely available. Possibly reflecting those sentiments, in April, Trump said directly that hewould not signa national abortion ban if reelected to the White House. Trump alsosaidthe decision to ban abortion should be left up to the states. In July, the Republican NationalCommittee softened languageon abortion that better reflected those views. Trump's current position on abortion reversed what he said in 2016 when he was first running for the presidency and was the opposite of statements he made throughout his time in office. Some scholars are concerned that conservative advisers to Trump have encouraged him to ban abortions by enforcing the 1873 Comstock Act. By enforcing this Victorian-era anti-vice law that is still on the books, but is not currently enforced, he could create a national ban and bypass the need for legislation. The Comstock law specifically bans the mailing of â€œobsceneâ€ materials used to produce an abortion.Some scholarsbelieve Trump could use the Justice Department to enforce a ban that would not just restrict people from sending the medication currently used in the majority of abortions through the mail, but would ban any kind of materials used to produce any kind of abortion. The Comstock law has also been used to banbirth control. Trump has not officially endorsed the enforcement of the Comstock Act, but it isa strategysome of his advisers have outlined, including former advisers who createdProject 2025;the Heritage Foundation's plan for the next Republican administration. Trump has not endorsed Project 2025. In an interview withCBS onMonday, when asked if he would enforce the Comstock Act, Trump said that â€œspecificsâ€ remained to be determined, but that he â€œgenerallyâ€ wouldn't enforce the act's prohibition against pills used for an abortion. Trump has not elaborated on what â€œgenerallyâ€ means, but he did add that â€œthe federal government should have nothing to do with this issue.â€ From CNN's Jen Christensen Harris claimed in her Thursday speech at the Democratic National Convention that Trump's proposed policies would raise prices for American families. â€œHe intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax, call it a 'Trump Tax,' that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year,â€ she said. Facts First:The claim is reasonable enough, but it's worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump's proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House. Trump has called for adding a tariffof 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to theCenter for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank. If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP. Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties wouldcost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be$1,350 a yearfor middle-income households. From CNN's Katie Lobosco Harris on Thursday said Trump fights for the wealthy, not the middle class. â€œInstead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends, and he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt,â€ Harris said during her remarks at the Democratic National Convention. Facts First:Harris is referring toTrump's vowto extend the provisions of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that expire next year. Her claim is mostly true, though extending the provisions would also help Americans who are not wealthy. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of Trump's key achievements in office, reduced taxes for most people, though the rich benefited far more than others. If the expiring provisions are made permanent, thehighest-income householdswould receive more than 45% of the benefits, according to a Julyanalysisby the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. If the law's provisions are made permanent, households making at least $450,000 – roughly the top 5% – would be the biggest winners, the analysis found. They would see their after-tax income increase by 3.2%. For those in the top 1%, who make at least $1 million, that boost equates to a tax cut of about $70,000, on average, in 2027. Middle-income households earning between roughly $65,000 and $116,000, on the other hand, would receive a tax cut of about $1,000, or 1.3% of their income, the analysis found. Overall, extending the 2017 tax law provisions would reduce taxes for about three-quarters of households but hike them for about 10%, according to the analysis. As for the impact on the national debt, extending the individual income and estate tax cuts, extending or maintaining some of the law's corporate tax changes, and taking interest into account would increase the deficit by more than $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. From CNN's Tami Luhby Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey highlighted Harris' recently announced plan to put in place anti-price gouging laws in an effort to lower the cost of food, saying Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, â€œPrices are up because these corporations are scheming to drive them up.â€ Facts First:Casey's remark lacks key context and overstates the role corporations have played in driving inflation, according to two papers published by regional Federal Reserve banks. The papers published by the two banks suggest corporations contributed to the inflation Americans have experienced in recent years; however, their pricing actions weren't the primary driver of inflation when it peaked at a four-decade high in 2022. Researchpublished by the Kansas City Fed last year found that corporate profits, which grew significantly in the first half of 2021 as firms raised prices at a faster pace than their costs were increasing, could have accounted for more than half the inflation Americans experienced that year. But by 2022, the rate at which corporations raised prices compared with their costs declined. The researchers concluded that corporations likely raised prices in 2020 and the early part of 2021 in anticipation of rising future costs. But price hikes corporations put forth then were not the main source of inflation in 2022. Research published by theSan Francisco Fedearlier this year reached a similar conclusion: that alleged corporate price gouging was not a primary catalyst for the inflation surge that occurred in 2021 and 2022. Ultimately, the inflation Americans have had to contend with over the past few years is the product of a confluence of events, including the war in Ukraine, government spending and pandemic-related disruptions across the economy. The unprecedented stress on supply chains in the thick of the pandemic, for example, contributed significantly to inflation's rise in early 2021. However, research from progressive think tanks, such asGroundwork Collaborative, suggests there's a more direct link between corporation raising prices and higher inflation.

The 2024 presidential election is now 99 days away following a historic month of political shake-ups that upended the race. Vice President Kamala Harris is seeing a rise in favorability ratings withpolls showing multiple paths to victory. Trump responded to Harris' momentum with a series of personal attacks over the weekend: he referred to her as â€œevil,â€ mocked her laugh and the pronunciation of her name, and said that â€œthe American dream is deadâ€ if Harris wins in November. The vice presidentpushed back on her opponent's â€œwild liesâ€and goaded him about debating her. Trump's selection of Ohio Sen.

The Park Fire, the seventh-largest wildfire in California history, has scorched more than 360,000 acres —an area larger than the city of Phoenix. It has destroyed over 100 structures and threatens thousands more, according to CalFire. The blaze was 12% contained as of early today but evacuation warnings or orders remained in Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties. The weather forecast for the Northwest calls for lighter winds than the area has seen in recent days, giving firefighters some optimism aboutslowing the progress of the blaze. In Oregon, the Durkee Fire is the largest wildfire burning in the state, at more than 288,000 acres. It has injured three people and destroyed four residences. Local authorities say the fire is 49% contained. Israel has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah after blaming the Lebanese militant group for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The strike killed 12 children who had beenplaying on a soccer field, further escalating tensions in the region. Hezbollah says it â€œfirmly deniesâ€ it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attacks. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes rocked Gaza duringanother weekend of heavy bombardment.

A strict abortion law is set to take effect in Iowa today, preventing most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. That's roughly when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, or possiblybefore many women know they are pregnant. The law passed last year, but a judge had blocked it from being enforced. Iowa is among nearly two dozen states that havebanned or limited accessto abortion procedures since the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to the procedure nationwide. Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and his political opponents both claimed to have won the presidential election on Monday as the US and multiple regional nationsvoiced skepticism about official results.

July4th,CNN,2023,"Rebekah Reiss, Holly Yan, Ryan Young, Emma Tucker",https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/us/shreveport-shooting-block-party/index.html,"4th victim found dead after a mass shooting at a Fourth of July block party in Shreveport, Louisiana","A fourth person has been found dead from a mass shooting at a Fourth of July block party in northern Louisiana, a police and a Shreveport city official said Wednesday – a shooting that also left seven others injured. At least 11 people were shot at the block party in Shreveport around 11:40 p.m. Tuesday, authorities have said. Police initially said three people were killed but later announced a fourth was found dead Wednesday. That person's body was discovered in an area with tall grass and dense vegetation, Shreveport Councilwoman Tabatha Taylor said. Officials are hoping to get a drone in the air to continue searching for other possible victims, Taylor said. The Caddo Parish Coroner's Office identified the victims as Morad Aziz, 22; Syncere Brown, 17; Jarike J. Dorsey, 19; and Demorie Williams, 24. â€œLast night was a horrible night here in Shreveport,â€ Shreveport Police Chief Wayne Smith told reporters Wednesday. Among the seven people who were shot and survived, one was in critical condition and six suffered non-life-threatening wounds, according to Shreveport police spokesperson Sgt. Angie Willhite. Philadelphia mass shooting suspect told police he did it to clean up the neighborhood, sources say â€œIt's believed that multiple males engaged in an exchange of gunfire,â€ Smith said. It's not clear what led up to the gunfire, which shattered a â€œfamily and community eventâ€ that had safely taken place for more than a decade, Taylor said. No suspects have been arrested. Johnnie Winn, who was at the block party,told CNN affiliate KSLAthat two of his friends were killed in the shooting. He's attended the annual party several times and many of the partygoers have lived in the area for decades, he told KSLA. Shortly before gunfire erupted, Winn â€œgot a weird vibeâ€ when he saw a few younger men start to follow other people, he told KSLA. Moments later, he saw roughly 10 to 15 people fighting before shots were fired and people started running, he said. The scene was chaos, Winn said. He hid under a truck with three people he didn't know, he told KSLA. â€œWe didn't know each other, but we protected each other,â€ he told the station. It was difficult for first responders to get to the victims due to the number of vehicles at the gathering, police toldKSLA. â€œGetting here and getting EMS here was a difficult thing. A lot of us had to park our cars and take off running because there were so many cars on the side of the street,â€ Shreveport police Lt. Van Wray told KSLA. With a potentially large number of witnesses, Taylor implored anyone with information to call police, even anonymously. â€œI am looking for justice for these families,â€ the councilwoman said, adding that the assailants â€œhave traumatized us in a way that is unfathomable.â€ The tragedy in Louisiana was amonga spate of mass shootingsacross the country over the Fourth of July weekend. In Baltimore, at another block party on Sunday,two people were killed and another 28 were shot and injured– mostly teenagers. Investigators aresearching for multiple assailants. A teen girl was killed and 4 others were injured in a shooting at an Indianapolis block party In Philadelphia,five people, including a 15-year-old boy,were killed Monday night. Authorities said the shooter appeared to fire randomly along several blocks of the city's Kingsessing neighborhood before officers arrested the suspect, who was found with an AR-style rifle and a handgun. In Texas, three people were killed and eight others were wounded in Fort Worth late Monday night – hours before the neighborhood'sFourth of July parade took place on the same street. And in Washington, DC, nine people were injured – including two minors – shortly before 1 a.m. Wednesday. Someone from a vehicle â€œfired shots in the direction of some of our residents that were outside just celebrating the Fourth of July,â€ Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Leslie Parsons said. Across the country, at least 412 people have been killed in mass shootings so far this year, according to theGun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the nonprofit defines mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot – not including the perpetrators.

July4th,CNN,2022,Stephen Collinson,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/04/politics/americans-divided-july-fourth-democracy/index.html,Americans divided over what US stands for on this July Fourth,"Rarely have Americans been so divided on what their country stands for as onthe 246th anniversary of independence. As red, white and blue fireworks burst in air on Monday night, politics may not be at the forefront of most people's minds. Yet a fractious partisan age is undeniably penetrating everyone's lives. If, as Abraham Lincoln said, a house divided against itself cannot stand, the years to come beckon even more national discombobulation. The unity for whichPresident Joe Bidenpleaded in his inaugural address seems more elusive than ever. US democracy is still fighting for its survival, as the House select committee investigating theJanuary 6, 2021, attackon the US Capitol revealsever more frightening detailsof Donald Trump's attempt to steal the 2020 election. The ex-President is, meanwhile,impatient to launch a 2024 campaignrooted in his election fraud lies that would highlight his increasingly autocratic tendencies. Related articleSupreme Court makes it clear there's a red America and a blue America In another example of startling political disruption, an activist Supreme Court, protected behind high metal fences in its marbled Washington chambers, just stripped away the constitutional right of millions of women to have an abortion. The decision validates a half-century campaign by conservative activists, many of whom have sincere moral objections against abortion, which they equate with the murder of an unborn child. But the Supreme Court's decision and the emerging patchwork system of abortion restrictions across the US have been met with outrage in other parts of America. On Sunday, South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential Republican presidential candidate, defended her state's abortion banon CNN's â€œState of the Unionâ€when asked whether a 10-year-old girl who was raped should be forced to give birth, or to explain how her state will care for women deprived of the right to end a pregnancy. Her evasions encapsulated how many supporters of abortion rights see hypocrisy and inhumanity among some of those who profess to care for life – and the irreconcilable divide on this issue in the country. Given the political discord boiling way beneath the surface of Monday's national celebrations, it's hardly surprising that a staggering 85% of US adults in anAssociated Press-NORC pollreleased last week said things in the country are headed in the wrong direction. The survey formalized what is obvious: for all its advantages, abundant resources, comparative prosperity and history of working to perfect its democracy, the United States is not a country at ease with itself right now. The clichÃ© that America's best days are ahead is becoming harder to believe. Social tensions are being exacerbated by economic pressure. Thewar in Ukraineis making food bills more expensive and spiked gasoline to record prices. Biden's struggling presidency appears out of ideas as to how to help after potentially worsening the situation by pumping hundreds of millions of dollars of spending into the economy. Gun crime in cities is recalling a more violent past and every Monday brings a grim accounting of the weekend's mass shootings. In the latest tragic outburst of violence, at least six people were killed and two dozen were injured ata shooting at a Fourth of July paradein the Chicago suburb of Highland Park on Monday. The exact circumstances of the incident were not immediately clear Monday afternoon as authorities launched a search for the perpetrator. The sense of a country politically on edge is being exacerbated by the shadow of Trump's violent coup attempt. Related articleThe Supreme Court's conservative majority is a threat to the world A flurry of restrictions on voting in many conservative-led states and the GOP's refusal to renew voting rights legislation harken back to a poisoned era of racial repression. Liberals who once dreamed of a new Franklin Roosevelt are dissatisfied with the results of their narrow monopoly on political power in Biden's Washington. But their radicalism also risks alienating the crucial middle ground of voters who ought to be up for grabs as the GOP dives right. Incredibly, the country is struggling to make enough infant formula to feed its babies – and is having to fly in emergency supplies from abroad – a metaphor if there ever was one for a time when things just don't seem to be going very well. And in some regions, the spectacles that bring Americans of all persuasions side by side – the July Fourth fireworks shows – are being dampened by bans imposed because the land is tinderbox dry because of global warming, another threat thatdefies a political consensus for action. Almost every day, there's a controversy or political fight that underscores the antagonism between more moderate, diverse and socially tolerant American cities and suburbs and the conservatism of rural America. Many leaders on both sides of the aisle accentuate differences for political gain, only adding to the sense of anger coursing through the country. Elected leaders who seek to bring those with divergent views together are an endangered species. Increasingly, for those who think about politics, each side of the divide sees the other as an existentialist threat to their idea of America – a schism of perception especially demonstrated in recent weeks by the fight between supporters and opponents of abortion rights. Related articleTrump weighs early 2024 launch as January 6 committee looms over his future On the right, disillusionment with government itself – which fueled Trump's rise and is being exacerbated by his election fraud lies – is a driving force in a Republican Party that is giving up on democracy. On the left, more and more people see a Supreme Court that is openly flouting majority opinion as illegitimate. The high court was once seen as above the partisan flames. But even its justices have been caught up in a tide of fury, with sniping more characteristic of social media than Supreme Court opinions. During oral arguments before last month's landmark overturning of Roe v. Wade, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered whether the court could â€œsurvive the stenchâ€ of stripping away abortion rights. In his majority opinion that did just that, Justice Samuel Alito relished dismissing the reasoning behind Roe as â€œegregiously wrong.â€ The Supreme Court was once seen as a moderating force for stability. But in its new zeal for ripping up precedents, the conservative majority has turned it into yet another destabilizing force in society. So what grounds are there for hope this Independence Day? Biden is insisting that things are not as bad as they seem, seeking to fulfill that part of a president's duties that involve bucking the country up. â€œYou haven't found one person, one world leader to say America is going backwards,â€ the President insisted as he wrapped up a visit to Europe last week. â€œAmerica is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. We have the strongest economy in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world,â€ he said, while being somewhat economical with the truth when it comes to the spike in inflation that he once dismissed. Biden, of course, has an interest in painting things in a better light than they are, especially with midterm elections approaching in which Democrats are likely to suffer from his sub-40% approval rating. But it's not all darkness. Biden has piloted the United States out of the depths of the pandemic recession. Prices might be high and consuming wage gains, but unemployment is around 50-year lows. This could cushion the impact of a recession many experts fear is on the way. Hindsight showed that Biden's declaration of partial independence fromCovid-19last July Fourth was premature – and politically unwise. But life is far closer to normal than it was a year ago and the United States is better prepared to handle any resurgence of Covid-19 in the fall. There are plenty of vaccinations to go around, though again, politics appears to be threatening the common good with refusal to take such precautions a badge of honor among some grassroots conservatives. Washington may not be as irredeemably broken as it seems. Since last year, Republicans and Democrats have combined to pass a huge new law fixing the country's aging infrastructure – a task that evaded recent presidents before Biden. And after a deal between Republicans and Democrats, the Senate passed one of the most sweeping firearms safety laws in a generation. The measure might have fallen far short of the pleas of grief-stricken family members of the mass shooting victims in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. But it was a sign that even in this vicious political climate, incremental change fashioned through political institutions is not impossible. For the first time in two decades, Americans are not fighting major wars abroad. And Biden's leadership of the West in standing up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine may represent the most significant show of American global leadership since the Cold War. The bravery of those who stood up to Trump's attempt to steal power in 2020 is also an inspiration this July Fourth. Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House January 6 committee, may alienate liberalswith her political views, but she's written herself a place in history by standing up for democracy, unlike many of her genuflecting GOP rivals who run perpetually scared from Trump. Cassidy Hutchinson, a former Trump White House aide, put far more senior colleagues to shame by showing how one person can take a stand for truth with her televised testimony before the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. And if the majority of the country that didn't want to see Roe reversed wants an example of turning demoralizing defeat into eventual victory, they can look to the years of activism by the anti-abortion movement to see how political change can be forged by generations of campaigners who stay committed to the goal. Because this July Fourth, America still does have a democratic political system that can be shaped by the people. At least, it does for now.

Biden noted that he had â€œsurged Federal law enforcement to assist in the urgent search for the shooter,â€ and pointed to thegun safety legislationhe recently signed into law. (Authorities said Monday evening they have taken into custody â€œa person of interestâ€ connected to the shooting.) â€œBut there is much more work to do, and I'm not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence,â€ Biden added. Later on Monday, Biden declined to say whether stricter gun laws would have prevented the deadly shooting when pressed by CNN's MJ Lee. â€œWe don't know the circumstances yet,â€ he said. Vice President Kamala Harris, who's in California for the holiday, touted the recently signed legislation in her own statement, but added, â€œToday's shooting is an unmistakable reminder that more should be done to address gun violence in our country.â€ Biden held a brief moment of silence at the White House Monday evening during a July Fourth picnic, noting that he'd spoken to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. In remarks commemorating the holiday with military families at the White House earlier in the afternoon, the President made reference to the new gun safety law and the Illinois shooting, saying, â€œYou all heard what happened today. â€¦ Each day we're reminded there's nothing guaranteed about our democracy, nothing guaranteed about our way of life.â€ Biden called on Americans to fight for democracy, while also broadly acknowledging national challenges. â€œOur economy is growing, but not without pain. Liberty is under assault – assault both here and abroad,â€ he said, alluding to the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last month. â€œIn recent days, there's been reason to think that this country is moving backwards. That freedom has been reduced. That rights we assumed are no longer – a reminder that we remain in an ongoing battle for the soul of America, as we have for over 200 years.â€ The July Fourth holiday comes amid a challenging time for the nation marked bydeepening division,inflationand arecent set of pollingshowing that the vast majority of Americans across party lines are unhappy with the state of the US. In anAP-NORC surveyreleased last week, 85% of US adults say that things in the country are headed in the wrong direction, with just 14% believing things are going in the right direction. That's a more pessimistic reading than in May, when 78% said things were headed the wrong way and 21% that things were generally moving in the right direction. And currently, both 92% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats are dissatisfied with the direction of the country – the highest number among Democrats since Biden took office last year. Still, Biden attempted to reassure Americans, saying, â€œI know it can be exhausting and unsettling, but tonight I want you to know we're going to get through all this.â€ America, he emphasized, is and always will be a â€œwork in progress.â€ â€œIt has so often been the case that after we've taken giant steps forward, we've taken a few steps backwards. And after doing the hard work of laying the foundation for a better future, the worst of our past has reached out and pulled us back on occasion. But I know this: From the deepest depths of our worst crises, we've always risen to our higher heights,â€ Biden told the crowd on the South Lawn. â€œWe've always come out better than we went in.â€ Earlier in the day, Biden had released a forward-looking statement about how the â€œbest days still lie ahead.â€ â€œThe Fourth of July is a sacred day in our country – it's a time to celebrate the goodness of our nation, the only nation on Earth founded based on an idea: that all people are created equal,â€ Biden said in atweet. â€œMake no mistake, our best days still lie ahead.â€ This story has been updated with additional developments.

The rapid bursts of a high-powered rifle brought the chilling reality that no one can be sure they are safe, anywhere, to one of the nation's most unifying gatherings. In that instant,Highland ParkjoinedUvalde, Columbine, Newtown and Parkland and a long list of cities and towns known across the country for the massacre of innocents in a gun violence contagion that makes the United States an outlier in developed societies. Related articleSuspect in connection with a mass shooting at July 4th parade in Highland Park, Illinois, has been taken into custody Detritus strewn at the scene, a lone shoe, discarded backpacks, upturned camping chairs and empty strollers did not just tell the story of the hurried panic of those who fled for their lives. It reflected yet another scene of normality shattered by a mass shooting. In this case, six people who simply went out to celebrate America on its birthday are dead. More than two dozen – aged 8 to 85, according to doctors – are injured. Only Monday's venue – on a day dedicated to national celebration – was variable. Similar horror unfolded in May in an elementary school in Texas and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Mass shootingstargeted graduation parties last monthin Texas and South Carolina. In Philadelphia, shooters sprayed a nightlife crowd. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, there was carnage in a medical center. In Brooklyn, the shooter was on the subway. Television pictures Monday of police vehicles in Highland Park rushing to help beneath a billowing American flag added an ironic, new dimension to this latest horror. It took place as Americans gathered to celebrate the 246th anniversary of the freedoms inherent in American independence. Yet what unfolded encapsulated the quintessentially American cycle of death by firearms. When a gunman killed three people ina mall shooting in Copenhagen, Denmark,over the weekend, it was shocking because it was unusual. But while Monday's shooting outside Chicago was unexpected, another mass shooting in the US was hardly a surprise. â€œIt is devastating that a celebration of America was ripped apart by our uniquely American plague,â€ Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. â€œA day dedicated to freedom has put into stark relief the one freedom we, as a nation, refuse to uphold: The freedom of our fellow citizens to live without the daily fear of gun violence.â€ Still, residents of the affluent, largely White suburb with a thriving Jewish community expressed shock that such horror visited their town. Somerelated scenesof wounded victims on the sidewalk, of families fleeing with their kids in terror and of one man who put his children inside a dumpster for safety. This was â€œjust inconceivable in a community like Highland Park,â€ Jeff Leon, an eye witness who at first thought the pops of the rifle were July Fourth fireworks, told CNN. Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider, who represents Illinois' 10th Congressional District, expressed similar disbelief. â€œNo one thinks that this could happen in our community, but that is true across the country,â€ he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. And Dr. Brigham Temple, medical director of emergency preparedness for NorthShore University HealthSystem, told reporters: â€œIt is a little surreal to have to take care of an event such as this.â€ Related article'People just falling and falling': Witnesses describe terror at Illinois parade shooting A common sentiment of people caught up in such mass shootings is disbelief that their community, which they had considered safe, has been hit. But in a nation awash in guns, nowhere is immune. Even at July Fourth celebrations across the country that were perfectly safe, how many of the attendees didn't have a flash of concern about their security? Having to think about the possibility of mass shooting – at a school or a movie theater or a place of worship – has now become part of life since it's happened so often. It's another weight of anxiety and stress on a national psyche strained by the Covid-19 pandemic, soaring inflation and vicious political divides that contributed toa pessimistic mood this July Fourth. Gun violence is hardly new in American society. But the proliferation of deadly weapons is now forcing people everywhere in the United States to face worries long endured by those familiar with the horrific toll of firearms in cities. It's gotten nowhere near as much coverage. But the high-profile shootings in Uvalde and Highland Park, for instance, are taking place against a backdrop of incessant killings elsewhere. There have been at least the 311 mass shooting in the United States so far this year, including 14 in just the first four days of this month, according to theGun Violence Archive. And it's only July. The suspect, Robert E. Crimo III, has been taken into custody near Lake Forest, Illinois, authorities said during a brief news conference Monday night after an hours-long manhunt. Sgt. Chris Covelli, of the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, said earlier in the day that the firearm used in shooting was a â€œhigh powered rifleâ€ but declined to give further details. If that is borne out, it would just be the latest occasion when a weapon with the capacity to quickly fire multiple rounds with deadly effect has been used in a mass shooting. President Joe Bidenand firearms safety advocates have called for a reinstatement of a nationwide assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. There is no chance, however, that such a measure could get through Republican opposition in the US Senate because of filibuster rules that require a 60-vote majority for major legislation. It's unlikely Democrats with their wafer-thin majority could pass it on their own, and they lack the votes needed to change the filibuster rules. Related articleBidens 'shocked' by Highland Park shooting as White House marks July Fourth The Highland Park mass shooting is the first to come to national attention since the passage of thefirst major gun safety legislationin Congress in a generation. It is far too early to know whether that measure – which poured new money into mental health resources and potentially slowed the pace at which people under 21 can get guns – could have prevented this tragedy or whether the incident will expose its limited scope. Biden and families of the victims of recent gun massacres had pleaded with Congress to do far more, but Republican opposition makes it all but impossible to pass meaningful overhauls of firearm laws, including expanded background checks. The July Fourth holiday meant that there was little immediate political reaction to Monday's mass killing from Republicans, even as Democrats such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Pritzker demanded more gun restrictions. The rituals of America's incessant mass shootings will likely now see Republicans try to point to other factors besides the availability of guns. It's true that most gun owners in America are law-abiding. But logic suggests that America's massive proliferation of guns compared with other nations and the high incidence of mass killings are linked. And it's clear that more people having guns – what the National Rifle Association would call â€œgood guys with gunsâ€ – isn't stopping all of these killings. Second Amendment activists insist that the right to own high-powered weapons is within every American's rights to bear arms. And the conservative US Supreme Court majority is setting about loosening existing gun restrictions. All of which suggests that Monday's shooting will result in no action that makes America safer. The heavy lift in passing even the limited gun safety legislation last month suggests that a gridlocked political system has already done as much as it can bear. Yet each recent mass shooting poses the same questions, which are especially acute on a day that America celebrates its freedoms. Why do the rights of those who insist they have the constitutional blessing to own such deadly weapons outweigh the right of others to life – especially since a majority of Americans support more comprehensive gun control? And why, for instance, should moms, dads, kids or grandparents have to so often run for their lives? â€œIt can happen any place,â€ Miles Zaremski, who witnessed the shooting in Highland Park, told CNN on Monday afternoon. â€œI've been around many years on this planet and what I observed shook me to the core.â€ â€œIf it can happen on July 4, in a peaceful law-abiding community that we have in Highland Park â€¦ it can happen any place.â€",0.495,0.505,0.0,-0.8691,0.148,0.757,0.095,-0.9979

America seems a lifetime away from the evening of November 4, 2008, when Barack Obama, walking on stage as the first Black president-elect in history,extolled the fact thatthe â€œdream of our foundersâ€ remained thrillingly alive into the 21st century. That dream, against all odds, remains alive in 2022. While it is, to be frank, an embattled dream, its tenacity can galvanize even the most cynical among us. Even as the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion invites anger and disbelief regarding the stability of American democratic institutions, ripples of hope abound. On June 25, President Bidensigned into lawthe only substantial federal gun legislation in nearly three decades. The bipartisan breakthrough came on the heels of mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas that broke the nation's heart and inspired not only anger and sadness, but action. America's democratic experiment, though bruised and struggling, continues and deserves to be celebrated – especially amidst the grave political divisions and growing despair of the present. But this year's July 4 celebrations come at a time of escalating political division, especially over the loss of women's bodily autonomy. The Supreme Court'sfrontal assault on Roe v. Wadeforces into question some of the most fundamental precepts of American democracy: namely the right of individuals to take charge of their own destinies without external threats or interference from their government, law enforcement or fellow citizens. Opinion: The Senate's framework on guns isn't politics as usual. It's a sea change On the eve of the United States' 246th birthday, it feels like the country is unraveling, ripping apart at the seams. Americans now face the grim prospect of a nation where the public has increasingly expansive access to guns and military-grade weapons on the one hand, and morerestrictions on voting rights,free speech in classroomsand reproductive rights. Assaults on democracy are now a fact of life, whether in the form of these restrictions or thedenial of the gravity of the January 6 attackon the US Capitol, even as witnesses appear before Congress to attest to it firsthand. This stark reality makes for a rather gloomy Independence Day celebration for the millions of true believers in democracy who – despite the GOP's fervent efforts – remain hopeful for an expansive interpretation of the Founders' dreams. The denial of women's citizenship rights in particular fits within a larger assault on historically marginalized groups that has become so prevalent within our body politic. The story of America continues to be one of becoming in service of a greater purpose than simple individual freedoms. The history of how Roe v. Wade came to be exemplifies the interconnectedness of various freedom struggles – women's federal protections came in tandem with those for Black people, just as protections for Blacks laid pivotal legal groundwork for other marginalized groups. Black-led civil rights struggles opened doors for gender equality throughout the 1970s, with1972's Title IX legislationpaving the way for women's collegiate sports by ending sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. Juneteenth, as much as the Fourth of July, is America's true birthday Recent transformative movements for racial justice led by Black women activists, including theBlack Lives Mattermovement and theWomen's March, illustrate the intersectionality of struggles for citizenship and dignity in ways that have forged extraordinary solidarity across gender and race. In this difficult moment for our democracy, this Independence Day is a moment to remind ourselves of that interconnected reality, and embrace its power. This Fourth of July demands that we remember who we were and who we are, but also ask difficult questions about what kind of country we aspire to be. Do we trust ourselves enough to openly teach, discuss and debate the hard parts of American history with our children and future generations, or do we move toward an insularity defined by uncritical thinking that cheapens that very history? Should we expand the right to vote or restrict access, rendering our country less democratic and a perpetual political tinderbox? Can we extend citizenship to all women by not only restoring Roe but safeguarding against other ongoing assaults on women's rights and dignity? Sign up for CNN Opinion'snewsletter.Join us onTwitterandFacebook Is the story of January 6 an important chapter in the continuing saga of American democracy or will it be the nation's epitaph – the beginning of an end that could have been avoided if we exhibited more faith in not only our founders but in each other? At the heart of Independence Day commemorations have always been questions about who we are as Americans. The newly recognized Juneteenth holiday adds an important and unifying historical layer to this narrative; one that finally acknowledges slavery's crucial role in the creation and transformation of the American republic. Four short years from now America turn 250. We still have time to turn that day into a symbol of national renewal instead of anger and division. Getting there will depend on the efforts of those who believe in multiracial, gender-equitable democracy to organize, teach, listen and learn. After all, at its best, the grandeur of the American experiment is that we, collectively, get to decide for ourselves who we are going to be.",0.145,0.712,0.142,-0.0093,0.086,0.791,0.123,0.9896

Today, we are closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.â€ The US, Biden said, is seeing â€œthe results of the unity of purpose.â€ â€œTogether, we're beating the virus. Together, we're breathing life into our economy. Together, we will rescue our people from division and despair. But together, we must do it. Over the past year, we've lived through some of our darkest days,â€ he said. â€œNow I truly believe – I give my word as a Biden – I truly believe we are about to see our brightest future. Folks, this is a special nation.â€ More than five months into their tenure, the Bidens used the July 4th holiday as an opportunity to host guests in person, and more than a thousand were anticipated to enjoy food and festivities for the Fourth on the South Lawn, culminating in fireworks on the National Mall. Those invited were mostly military families and essential workers, who could bring their families, a nod of gratitude to service members and those who kept the country going during the darkest days of the pandemic. But the celebration comes at a timewhen federal officialsare warning about theDelta variantand doubling down on getting the rest of the US population vaccinated and protected. Related articleBiden's Fourth of July celebrations clouded by a gnawing concern over the Delta variant of Covid-19 The White House asked everyone attending on Sunday to get tested for Covid-19 before the event and wear masks if they are not fully vaccinated, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Psaki said all attendees received guidance that they should get tested for Covid-19 one to three days in advance of the event. She said those who are fully vaccinated can abide by public health guidelines and aren't required to wear masks. A White House official told CNN there is some concern about the optics of the holiday party now that the Delta variant is creeping its way across vulnerable populations of the United States. â€œDo we wish we were doing this having completely eradicated Covid? Yes, of course,â€ said the official, noting there was never discussion about pulling the plug on the party. â€œWe're moving ahead – with this event, with the initiatives, with trying to get people vaccinated. All of it.â€ The White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeffrey Zients, earlier Sunday defended the White House's decision not to require those who attend the first big bash to be vaccinated. â€œI think most of these folks are vaccinated,â€ Zients told CNN's Dana Bash on â€œState of the Union.â€ â€œBut at the end of the day, it's an individual choice, we hope all individuals make the right choice here and get vaccinated as soon as possible.â€ In a sign of the heightened concern about the variant, the White House announced last week that it would be deploying response teams made up of officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency across the US to areas with a high spread of the Delta variant. The teams will conduct surge testing, provide therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies and deploy federal personnel to areas that need support staff for vaccinations. White House officials also recently acknowledged the nation would fall short of Biden's July Fourth Covid-19 vaccination goals, saying the country has more work to do to get younger Americans vaccinated. The President had aimed to get 70% of US adults to have at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot and to have 160 million Americans fully vaccinated by July Fourth. According to the CDC, as of Friday before the holiday weekend, 67% of US adults have had at least one shot. â€œToday we have the power of science. Thanks to our heroic vaccine effort, we've gained the upper hand against this virus. We can live our lives. Oour kids can go back to school. Our economy is roaring back,â€ Biden said Sunday. â€œDon't get me wrong, Covid-19 has not been vanquished. We all know powerful variants have emerged like the Delta variant. But the best defense against these variants is to get vaccinated. My fellow Americans, it's the most patriotic thing you can do,â€ he added. â€œSo please, if you haven't gotten vaccinated. Do it. Do it now. For yourself, for your loved ones, for your community, and for your country.â€ Zients told reporters last week that he expects the US to hit the vaccination goal in weeks, and on Sunday, he said the federal government would continue to make vaccines more accessible for the public to increase the numbers. â€œWell, we made a lot of progress. I think we're much further along than anyone would have anticipated at this point,â€ Zients told Bash, when asked why the administration fell short. The party on Sunday was far larger than what was initially expected for the holiday. In March, Biden said he was hopeful that Americans would be able to gather with family and friends on July Fourth to celebrate the holiday in small groups in backyards as more and more Americans got vaccinated. Since then, because of the national vaccination effort, Covid-19 restrictions have been pulled back across the country and the CDC has said Americans who are fully vaccinated don't have to wear masks indoors or outdoors in most situations. The White House official told CNN there would be food stations at the party that include American favorites like hot dogs and hamburgers, chicken and other selections that reflect the holiday. The decorations will be substantial and more apparent than anything the Biden White House has put forward so far, according to one person familiar with the planning. The White House has enlisted outside events companies for help – something the Trump and Obama administrations also did for large-scale events. The White House's theme for the holiday weekend is â€œAmerica's Back Together,â€ promoting the idea that much of the nation is returning to pre-pandemic lifestyles as Americans get vaccinated. The President traveled to Traverse City, Michigan, on Saturday to tout the administration's response to the pandemic and celebrate the progress that has been made. The first lady, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff also took trips on Friday and Saturday as part of the weekend celebrations. Biden's Cabinet is deploying across the country to more than a dozen states to attend roundtables and baseball games and visit fire stations, festivals, parades, cookouts and more. â€œIt's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America. Never!â€ Biden said as he concluded his remarks Sunday evening. â€œWe just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there is nothing – nothing we can't do if we do it together.â€ This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.

But underneath the jubilation was a gnawing concern that pockets of the United States remainin the grips of the pandemic,awash in cases of thehighly transmissible Delta variantand populated with people who refuse to get vaccinated. Even as a crowded South Lawn represented scenes of celebration across the country, concerns about the continuing spread of the virus remain strong inside the administration, which announced this week it would dispatch response teams across the US to communities where officials are worried about a potentially deadly combination: low vaccination rates and a significant presence of the highly transmissible form of the virus. In private meetings, Biden has questioned advisers about the broader impact the highly contagious variant could have on the US, according to people present. He still receives a daily report on case rates, the number of deaths and the prevalence of variants. Officials have stressed that vaccinated people are safe, while those who are unvaccinated are the most at risk. Related articleBidens host first big White House event of their tenure for July 4th In a sign that the pandemic is far from over, officials also said the administration plans to extend the public health emergency declaration for the pandemic that former President Donald Trump announced in 2020 when it's due to expire this month. And foreign travel to countries where the Delta variant is resurgent, including the United Kingdom, is still on hold as officials hope to avoid new cases coming in to the US, despite heightened pressure from foreign governments and the travel industry to open up. The rise of the Delta variant in the UK is the â€œprimary reasonâ€ the US has not eased travel restrictions there, a senior health official told CNN. An administration official said their goal is to reopen international travel when it can be done safely but did not provide updates on when that's expected to happen. There are working groups between the US and other nations that are constantly evaluating the situation. The competingimpulses to celebrate progressagainst the virus while maintaining vigilance against further spread have colored the White House's approach to the second pandemic-era Fourth of July holiday. Biden has come down overwhelmingly on the side of celebration, dispatching his wife, the vice president and other senior members of his administration to declare â€œAmerica's Back Togetherâ€ at parades, cookouts and fire stations across the country. Biden himself traveled Saturday to Traverse City, Michigan, where the annual Cherry Festival is underway again after officials canceled it last year. There was some concern inside the White House about the optics of the July 4th party, with the Delta variant creeping its way across vulnerable populations of the US, according to one official. But there was never consideration of canceling the event. Guests were advised to get a test up to three days before the party, but won't be required to have been vaccinated. Masks for vaccinated people won't be required, in keeping with current guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. â€œDo we wish we were doing this having completely eradicated Covid? Yes, of course,â€ said the official, who said there was never discussion about pulling the plug on the party. â€œWe're moving ahead, with this event, with the initiatives, with trying to get people vaccinated. All of it.â€ On CNN's â€œState of the Unionâ€ on Sunday, Jeff Zients, the President's coronavirus response coordinator, defended the White House's decision not to require those who attend the first big bash to be vaccinated, saying that there's â€œvery rigorous testing and screening protocols.â€ â€œI think most of these folks are vaccinated,â€ Zients said, adding, â€œBut at the end of the day, it's an individual choice, we hope all individuals make the right choice here and get vaccinated.â€ Biden hoped to proclaim this weekend that 70% of American adults had received at least one Covid-19 shot. But officials acknowledged more than a week ago the goal wouldn't be met as they struggle to convince still-resistant Americans to get shots. About 67% of Americans 18 and older had received at least one shot, according toCDC datareported Saturday. For Biden and his aides, reality is setting in that getting the entire country vaccinated will be the work of his entire presidency – and that pockets of the nation where vaccination rates remain low will continue to suffer outbreaks that hamper the nationwide recovery effort. Most US adults who plan to get vaccinated against Covid-19 have already done so, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report released this week. While they have declined to rule it out, officials do not currently expect Biden to set any more numerical goals when it comes to vaccinations, given the US has still not reached his last one and the pace of vaccinations has slowed significantly, according to people familiar with the discussions. Instead, officials plan to simply push to get as many Americans vaccinated as soon as possible. A recent CNN analysis of the most recent vaccination data from the CDC finds that more than one in 10 Americans have missed their second shot. Officials say it is more vital than ever that Americans receive their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, since protection against the Delta strain is dramatically bolstered with the additional dose. New questions have also emerged over whether mask mandates could return should the variant cause a spike in cases – a possibility the White House has sought to publicly dispel after trumpeting the lifting of mask recommendations earlier this spring. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, said Thursday the Delta variant of coronavirus remains a serious threat in the United States and could cause more Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated communities – especially those in the Southeast and Midwest. â€œLooking state by state and county by county, it is clear that communities where people remain unvaccinated are communities that remain vulnerable,â€ Walensky said. She said as the Delta variant continues to spread in the US, the nation has seen a recent increase in its seven-day average of Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, the CDC reported 14,875 new cases of Covid-19. The nation's current seven-day average is about 12,600 cases per day. Biden said Friday he is not concerned about another widespread Covid outbreak – but acknowledged he was wary of unvaccinated people catching the Delta variant at holiday gatherings. â€œI am concerned that people who have not gotten vaccinated have the capacity to catch the variant and spread it to other people who have not been vaccinated,â€ Biden told reporters at an event on the economy. â€œI am not concerned that there's going to be a major outbreak.â€ Biden reiterated his fears that â€œlives will be lostâ€ should more people continue to resist getting vaccines. â€œDon't think about yourself, think about your family. Think about those around you,â€ he said. â€œThat is what we should be thinking about today. The Fourth of July this year is different than the Fourth of July last year and it will be better next year.â€ In some ways, this weekend is the moment Biden predicted two months into his presidency, standing in the Cross Hall of the White House. â€œIf we do our part, if we do this together, by July the Fourth there's a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day,â€ Biden said in March, a long red carpet stretching behind him, setting a months-away goal for returning the country to normal. Officials insist the relative normalcy of this year's holiday compared to the months spent under social distancing and mask restrictions was a signal Biden's strategy had worked. â€œWe made a lot of progress. I think we're much further along than anyone would have anticipated at this point,â€ Zients told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday, when asked why the administration fell short. He added that the administration plans to â€œdouble down on our efforts to vaccinate millions of more Americans across July and August.â€ Much of that work has shifted to states where the combination of low vaccination rates and high caseloads have caused fears of backsliding. â€œWe are now going in the wrong direction yet again with Covid-19 infections here in the state of Arkansas,â€ said Dr. Cam Patterson, chancellor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, during the state's weekly briefing last week. Hoping to target the regional outbreaks, the White House said last week it was deploying response teams to conduct surge testing, provide therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies and deploy federal personnel to areas that need support staff for vaccinations. The White House coronavirus team is spearheading the effort and officials expect the teams will help with everything from boosting testing, providing supplies and potentially increasing paid media efforts targeting regions where vaccinations are low. Still, while the response teams are being sent to prop up communities, officials believe vaccinations are the number one way to stop the spread and recognize there could be a limit to their efforts. Already, the administration has shifted its strategy from focusing on mass vaccination sites to more targeted efforts to get people shots. Health officials have narrowed their focus to young people in particular, who account for a large number of the still-unvaccinated. They also remain focused on minorities, whose vaccination rates lag behind the White population. Recognizing the concern over the variant, the Biden administration flooded television networks with top federal health officials last week to address concerns ahead of the July 4th weekend. And officials sought to balance what is undoubtedly a moment to mark progress against the virus with the nagging problem that large swaths of the country still appear resistant to vaccines. â€œYou can still celebrate at the same time as you get your message very, very clear: if you were vaccinated, you have a high degree of protection. If you are not, you should wear a mask, and you should think very seriously about getting vaccinated,â€ Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Thursday. â€œSo, in so many respects, nothing has really changed,â€ Fauci said. â€œWe are celebrating as a country at the same time as we recognize the fact that we're in a serious situation for those who have not been vaccinated. And the message is: Get vaccinated.â€ This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.

But it's a great time to be an American Coronavirus cases have been rising in 36 states with California, Arizona, Texas and Florida all posting record numbers of new infections this week. The Florida Department of Health reported 11,445 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday – yet another record for new coronavirus cases reported in a single day. The previous record was set on Thursday, with 10,109 cases. Nationwide, the virus has killed more than 129,000 people and infected over 2.8 million since the pandemic started, according to Johns Hopkins University. And for the third straight day Friday,the number of new cases surpassed 50,000 nationwide. Despite the bleak milestones,President Donald Trumpsaid Saturday that 99% of coronavirus cases â€œare totally harmlessâ€ and the rising number of cases are caused by increased testing. â€œNow we have tested, almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases – 99% of which are totally harmless — results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have. Not in terms of the numbers, or in terms of the quality,â€ Trump said during remarks on the White House South Lawn. Of the 36 states whose new cases have gone up this week compared to the previous one, nine of them have increased by over 50%. They are Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, Alaska and Delaware. People yearning for some normalcy hosted barbecues, found crowds in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and attended gatherings to watch fireworks. Meanwhile, others were finding beaches in Miami and Los Angeles closed, tubing in Texas rivers banned and some city celebrations happening mostly on livestreams. Without stringent safety measures, health experts fear the holiday weekend could bring a wave of new infections that could overwhelm hospitals. To avoid a public health disaster, they're imploring people to wear masks, skip bars and crowded places, and avoid mixing with people outside of their households. â€œWhat we know is that our behavior is the most powerful tool we have right now against the virus,â€ said Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, surgeon general of California. â€œAnd we really need folks to, you know, step up. I know that folks are tired, but it's absolutely critically important.â€ Beaches in Huntington Beach, California, would typically be packed with beachgoers this weekend. Just two weeks ago on June 14, photos showed the beach packed with people, towels and umbrellas. But on Saturday, beaches in the Los Angeles area are closed due to rising Covid-19 cases, and beaches were left empty with large stretches of untouched white sand. Renee Van Arsdale, who was riding bikes with her husband near the beach, told CNN there would usually be a â€œsea of peopleâ€ on the beach for July Fourth. â€œBut today it's mostly locals just enjoying the beauty of the beach instead of being on the beach,â€ she said. Her husband, Gary Van Arsdale, pointed out that the city of Huntington Beach had to cancel its annual July Fourth parade. Instead, the city put on a neighborhood tour with small-vehicle caravans that weaved through the streets with local dignitaries. Beaches were open elsewhere, like New York's Coney Island. There were also beachgoers at Clearwater Beach in Florida, though there were fewer than typical for the holiday weekend. At Clearwater, some had gathered in groups, according to a CNN crew on the scene, despite signs on the beach that warned not to gather in groups of 10 or more. But many at the beach told CNN they were taking certain precautions like wearing masks and having hand sanitizer at the ready. Local resident Connor Gourley — who believed he had the coronavirus earlier in the year and recovered — told CNN he wasn't â€œnecessarily concernedâ€ about being on the beach. He wasn't going to let concerns about the virus stop him from celebrating Independence Day, he said. â€œIt's not more about the partying, it's about celebrating America and our Independence Day,â€ he said. â€œSo, no matter what we're going to be out here and we're going to be American and enjoy our freedom.â€ Some officials have made small exceptions for July Fourth festivities, so long as people adhere to restrictions. In Harris County, Texas, Judge Lina Hidalgo issueda countywide orderprohibiting outdoor gatherings of 10 or more except for a handful of activities, including fireworks. The order, signed Friday, says fireworks displays and gatherings with more than 100 people are allowed only if people view the celebrations from inside a vehicle. The order will remain in effect through at least Wednesday, August 26. It also includes exceptions for gatherings of 10 or more people at religious services, youth camps, swimming pools and certain sporting events. â€œI think this is the real challenge we have,â€ Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of Harris County Public Health, told CNN Saturday. â€œIt's 4th of July now. All of us should be coming together as Americans to fight this pandemic. It is not just going to go away.â€ In Georgia, where coronavirus cases are going up, about 1,400health care workerssigned a letter to Gov. Brian Kemp asking him to increase state restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The letter dated Thursday urged the governor to close bars and nightclubs and prohibit indoor gatherings of more than 25 people, including at places of worship. It also recommends a statewide face covering requirement that allows mayors and county officials to institute requirements appropriate for their jurisdictions. â€œDuring the past week we have seen a sharp spike in cases that cannot be accounted for by increased testing. We also are seeing a very troubling increase in hospitalizations that, if continuing, will overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, not only in metro Atlanta but also in rural Georgia,â€ the letter said. Dr. Jesse Couk, the chair of infectious disease at Shepherd Center and a doctor at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, told CNN he worked with other doctors and health care professionals to create the letter after he became frustrated with lack of action after a spike in cases. Couk and other medical contacts worked together to create the letter and have other health care professionals sign it. He said he wanted to highlight the need for increased social distancing and further restrictions to slow the spread and was speaking as a member of the Infectious Disease Society of Georgia and not as a representative of Piedmont Atlanta. Mask mandates for Texas and Kansas went into effect Friday,which means 19 states and Washington, DC, now have such requirements. â€œWe have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheck, but it requires each of us to do our part â€¦ and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces,â€ Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said. Related articleCoronavirus is surging in Florida -- and so is anxiety over Trump's chances with senior voters Other governors have also issued statewide orders, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois and Michigan. And in Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order granting mayors in 89 counties the authority to issue mask requirements. It allows local governments to issue the mandates if a surge requires more preventative measures. â€œWhile our densely populated urban areas continue to have the highest Covid-19 case rates, our local governments expressed a need for greater flexibility in addressing a rise in cases and that includes setting stronger expectations around masks,â€ Lee said in a statement. â€œThis targeted approach ensures we protect both lives and livelihoods and safely keep our economy open in Tennessee.â€ In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the beaches will be open to thousands of visitors for the holiday weekend — but with a mask requirement to help stop the spread, Mayor Brenda Bethune said. Rising demand for Covid-19 testing has led some major commercial laboratories to report delays in turning around test results. Testing demands have reached â€œunprecedented levels,â€ commercial laboratory Quest Diagnostics said this week, leading to delays in notifying clients of their results. Although Quest can provide results within a day for priority patients — including sick health care workers and people in the hospital — the average turnaround time is three to five days for most other patients, the company said in a statement Monday. While the number of tests conducted across the US is increasing, experts say long turnaround times can make it difficult to isolate confirmed cases and quickly quarantine their close contacts. Another commercial laboratory, LabCorp, is reporting delays. The company told CNN in a statement Saturday that reporting test results may take one to two days longer now, leading to a current turnaround time of two to four days on average. â€œIn recent weeks, we have seen a steady increase in demand for molecular testing and we are doing everything we can to continue delivering results in a timely manner while continually increasing testing capacity,â€ LabCorp said.

Related articleTrump tries to drag America backward on a very different July 4th Still, Trump – who has a long track record of exploiting racial tensions in America – castigated others for trying to â€œfoment hate, discord and distrust.â€ â€œWe will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord and distrust,â€ Trump said. In his remarks at Mount Rushmore Friday and at the White House on Saturday, Trump sought to cast himself as the protector of American history and heritage, focusing on protecting the legacy of Founding Fathers and other historical American figures. But Trump has spent the last week focused squarely on defending Confederate monuments and namesakes. Related articleThe 28 most outrageous lines from Donald Trump's Mount Rushmore speech â€œOur past is not a burden to be cast away,â€ Trump said at the White House's â€œSalute to Americaâ€ event on the South Lawn. â€œWe will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children or trample on our freedoms. We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs, and beliefs,â€ Trump said. Trump claimed without evidence during his Saturday remarks that 99% of coronavirus cases â€œare totally harmless.â€ â€œNow we have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases — 99% of which are totally harmless — results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have. Not in terms of the numbers, or in terms of the quality,â€ he said, once again also falsely claiming that rising cases are caused by increased testing. There have been more than 2.8 million cases of coronavirus in the United States and at least 129,000 people in the United States have died, according toJohns Hopkins University's latest tally. Some people who become ill have only mild symptoms, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 35% of cases are asymptomatic, but even people with mild or no symptoms can spread the virus to others. While the World Health Organization has said the global fatality rate is likely less than 1%, the WHO also said about 20% of all people who are diagnosed with coronavirus are sick enough to need oxygen or hospital care. The White House has not returned CNN's request for comment on the President's claim. Trump spoke more about the coronavirus Saturday than he did the night before in South Dakota, but he used mention of the virus to underscore his divisive message. â€œChina must be held accountableâ€ for the virus, he said, and again claimed that a vaccine will be available before the end of the year. Despite a rise in coronavirus cases across the United States, many attendees seen at the White House's event were not practicing social distancing or wearing masks ahead of the President's remarks, CNN observed. The Washington, DC, celebration did not appear to be following CDC guidelines concerning gatherings despite deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere telling CNN this week that the White House would enforce social distancing. CNN has asked the White House whether guests are being tested or having temperatures checked but has yet to receive a response. The White House stopped temperature checks of all those entering the White House grounds weeks ago. Reporters at Saturday's event have not been tested or received a temperature check. Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, who is attending the White House's Fourth of July event, declined to comment on the event and the lack of social distancing. â€œGood question, but let me just see,â€ Giroir, the assistant secretary for health for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said when asked if the White House event was setting a good example for other Americans. â€œI'm reserving judgment.â€ He noted: â€œMy wife and I are both wearing a mask.â€ Trump's remarks at the White House come a day after he delivereda deeply divisive speech in South DakotaFriday night aimed at stoking the culture wars in America, warning, â€œOur nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children.â€ It was the kind of dark message the President has turned to often in recent weeks to incite his most loyal supporters as he attempts to ignore a pandemic in the face ofskyrocketing coronavirus cases. There was no social distancing at the Mount Rushmore event, especially with chairs at the top of the amphitheater tied together with zip ties. The President mentioned the virus just once in his Friday speech, at the very top of his remarks, thanking those working to fight it.

The Biden campaign on Saturday also responded to Trump's Mount Rushmore speech by saying the United States is â€œsufferingâ€ as a result of having a â€œdivisiveâ€ president who doesn't â€œgive a damn about anything but his own gain.â€ â€œOur whole country is suffering through the excruciating costs of having a negligent, divisive president who doesn't give a damn about anything but his own gain - not the sick, not the jobless, not our constitution, and not our troops in harm's way,â€ campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement of Trump. â€œEven as the outbreak ramps up, he's admitted to ordering that the federal testing response be watered down.â€ This story has been updated with additional developments.

We communicated to them that we do not think that this is in keeping with the best (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and (DC) Department of Health guidance, but this event will take place entirely on the federal property,â€ Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters during a news conference. Earlier Wednesday, the Department of Interior and National Park Service announced additional details about the President's Independence Day celebration on the National Mall, which include a 35-minute firework display and a flyover from military branches. The event will be livestreamed. Bowser has repeatedly encouraged Washington residents to celebrate July Fourth at home this year to avoid spread of the deadly virus.

Last month, the White Houseannouncedthat the President and first lady Melania Trump would host the 2020 â€œSalute to Americaâ€ on the White House South Lawn and the adjacent 52-acre Ellipse, concluding â€œwith a spectacular fireworks display over the National Mall.â€ â€œIn addition to music, military demonstrations, and flyovers to honor our Nation's service members and veterans, the President will deliver remarks that celebrate our independence and salute our amazing heritage,â€ the White House said in a statement. The Interior Department on Wednesday also encouraged those planning on viewing the fireworks to practice social distancing, wear a face mask, avoid shaking hands, wash hands often, and avoid attending if showing symptoms. The department said it will provide more than 300,000 cloth face coverings to attendees and that more than 100 hand washing stations will be located around the National Mall, though it remains unclear how or if social distancing will be enforced. Trump hasremained intenton holding the celebration this year despite opposition from Democrats and local lawmakers. Congressional Democrats in May raised concerns that the â€œSalute to Americaâ€ would â€œneedlessly risk the health and safety of thousands of Americansâ€ and â€œcost of millions of taxpayer dollars while we are facing an unprecedented economic downturn due to the pandemic.â€ Trump and the first lady will also travel to Mt.

Protests from a group called Refuse Fascism were planned for the day in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. It would be a familiar scene, since protests have taken place in just about every major city in the country since the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody in April. About 50 protesters holding Defund the Police and Black Lives Matter signs marched on Dale Mabry Highway and blocked traffic Saturday in Tampa, Florida, police said. Videos posted on social media corroborated an official statement by Tampa police spokeswoman Vanessa Nettingham. In Pittsburgh, counterprotesters showed up at a boat parade that was being held in support of President Donald Trump. Pittsburgh Public Safety reported no violence, arrests or injuries at the opposing protest events that lasted just over two hours in the Riverwalk area along the Monongahela River, according to its official Twitter page. Trump supporters and counterprotesters were â€œyelling and cursing at each other,â€ but there was no violence, according to Pittsburgh Public Safety, which urged people to avoid the area. Both sides are dispersing.https://t.co/meSiEhB00X Protesters did stop traffic at times, shutting down the Hot Metal Bridge at one point during the protests, according to Pittsburgh Public Safety. â€œPublic Safety does and will continue to respect everyone's 1st Amendment rights. However, throwing or dropping objects or suspending signs from bridges is prohibited and will result in immediate arrest. Stay safe, everyone,â€ Pittsburgh Public Safetysaid in a tweet.

July4th,CNN,2024,John Blake,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/04/us/fourth-july-america-blake/index.html,Our country is in chaos. But it's a great time to be an American,"On July 9, 1776, a rowdy group of American colonists banded together at a political rally in New York City and did something that today would be called â€œbadass.â€ They had just been treated to a public reading of the Declaration of Independence, whichCongress had officially adoptedless than a week earlier. After hearing calls to â€œdissolve the political bandsâ€ of tyranny, they marched to a public park that featured a statue of King George III, Britain's ruler, and knocked the 4,000-pound statue off its 15-foot pedestal. The head of the statue was then decapitated and perched on top of a spike, and much of the rest was melted down to make 42,000 musket balls for American soldiers. The historian Erika Doss thought of that scene recently while watching protesters toppling statues of Confederate heroes. Doss, who recounts the 1776 episode in her book, â€œMemorial Mania,â€ sees a parallel between the colonists who fought against Great Britain and protesters who rail against Confederate monuments today. â€œThey're patriots,â€ says Doss, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame, of today's protesters. â€œThey're looking at the symbols and these visual and martial emblems and icons in their midst and they're saying this doesn't stand for who we are today.â€ It's easy to be cynical this Fourth of July weekend as the US celebrates its birth. The country seems like a mess. Racial protests have rocked every major city. Unemployment has soared. And Americans can't even agree if they should wear face masks in the middle of a pandemic. But what some see as chaos, others see as an explosion of patriotism. They see it in the armies of Americans that took to the streets to protest racism. They see it in the companies that are taking unprecedented stands against racial and social injustice. Even the Americans who are wearing masks for the health of their neighbors – they, too, are reasons to wave the flag. All of these different groups have declared their independence from symbols and ideas that they've decided no longer represent them, Doss and others say. They are doing what their ancestors did in 1776, Doss says: â€œThey are reimagining themselves and the nation.â€ The evidence of this reimagining is reflected in the headlines. Something has shifted in America when the Mississippi state flag, which bears the cross of the Confederate battle flag,is taken downwhile the popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement soars to an all-time high. Recent polls suggest that this year's BLM protests, which drew as many as 26 million people, werethe largest movement in US history. Am I racist?

The protesters who flooded the streets this spring to protest racism exemplify the revolutionary spirit of America just as much as the white colonists in powdered wigs, saysMelanye Price, a professor at Prairie View A&M University in Texas who specializes in African-American politics. â€œThe people who are out yelling in the streets today are no different than Paul Revere yelling 'The British are coming!â€' says Price. â€œIt's the American way to voice criticism of the government and to rebel against oppressive forces.â€ In some ways, the protesters who took to the streets this year did a better job of honoring the words of the Declaration of Independence than the Founding Fathers, she says. Many of our nation's founders were slave owners who treated Black Americans as tools for economic profit. When they said, â€œall men are created equal,â€ that didn't include Black people, who were not considered fully human. They didn't consider women equal, either. But Black people extracted concepts from the Declaration of Independence, like the right to protest, and â€œturned them into tools for American citizenship,â€ Price says. â€œThey took the words of the founders and rammed them up their damn throats.â€ It's easy to forget, but the person who became the catalyst the American Revolution was not a White man. He was half Black and half Native American. His name wasCrispus Attucks, and he was killed during the 1770 Boston Massacre, an event that sparked the Revolutionary War. The person who sparked the unprecedented wave of racial protests this year was also a Black man. George Floyd, who died while being arrested in May by Minneapolis police, is in some ways a modern-day Attucks, says Jerald Podair, a historian at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. â€œAttucks died not knowing what his impact and significance would be, as did George Floyd,â€ says Podair. History textbooks tell us that American heroes are almost always White men carrying guns. A reader has to dig to learn about people like Sacagawea, the Native American woman whose language skills and bravery saved the vaunted Lewis & Clark expedition of the early 19th century. This year's protests, though, have enlarged the definition of a what an American hero looks like. Some of the leaders and participants in Black Lives Matter protests are LGBTQ. The movement is multiracial and multiethnic. And in some ways these protesters are just as tough as their colonial forebears. The history books love to tell stories of theMinutemen, the elite band of Revolutionary War soldiers who were ready at a minute's notice to rush into battle. The Black Lives Matter protesters and others who recently took to the streets to demonstrate were not that different. They risked their lives, often on short notice via a text or social media alert, to demonstrate against racism in the middle of a pandemic. Age made no difference. Many of those demonstrators were young – some even too young to vote. They took rubber bullets to the face and swallowed tear gas. And then they came back the next day, like soldiers. If you think that characterization is hyperbolic, listen to the words of another American hero who praised millennials – people born between 1981 and 1996 – in a recent speech. He said the country's youth make him optimistic about the future. â€œThey're not a lot like my generation – in many ways, they are better,â€ he said. â€œThey care so much about their friends, they care about the issues, they question things in a way that I'm not sure we baby boomers questioned. They will take a stand on issues.â€ The speaker? Retired Adm. William McRaven, the Navy SEAL who oversaw the Osama bin Laden raid. The coronavirus pandemic has also enlarged the definition of an American hero. We've learned that courage isn't just manifested in a SEAL team raid. It also can be summoned in mundane places like a health clinic, a grocery store or a meatpacking plant. The pandemic has led many Americans to realize how dependent they are on these service workers, who risk their lives to keep the country running. The colonists often invoked the term â€œlibertyâ€ to celebrate a form of rugged individualism where government and rules left them alone so they could live their version of freedom. So do many modern-day Americans. But democracy also depends on a sense of shared community, says Podair, the Lawrence University historian. â€œOur life and health depends on the behavior of other people,â€ he says. â€œWe depend on our neighbor, sometimes to get us food or just to remain healthy – and they on us. Because of the pandemic, America is a more democratic nation today than it was in February.â€ The Black Lives Matter protesters may exceed the Founding Fathers in another way – they're forcing the nation to face its racism. When Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence, he added language that described the slave trade as a perverse plot by an evil English king to contaminate the colonies, Joseph J. Ellis recounts in â€œFounding Brothers,â€ hisPulitzer Prize-winning book. That passage, though was deleted by the Continental Congress in the final draft. The issue was so contentious and ingrained in colonial society that many founders thought abolishing slavery would kill the young nation in its infancy, Ellis wrote. But a new generation of Americans are determined to do what the Founding Fathers refused to do. Americans are devouring books on racism and corporate America is taking a stand against racial injustice. Ordinary people are talking about racism with a new depth that's remarkable, says Doss, the historian. â€œIt has been so interesting to see how words like white supremacy and imperialism are part of daily American vocabulary in ways now that were not a couple of years ago,â€ she says. This change didn't just happen. It took years of planning and activism. â€œA multiracial fusion coalition has shifted public opinion in this country, and we've seen a tipping point in the past month,â€ says the Rev. William Barber II, a 2018 MacArthur Foundation â€œgeniusâ€ grant winner and president ofRepairers of the Breach, a nonpartisan group that seeks to build a moral agenda around issues of poverty and racism. â€œMany of us have been building this coalition for years, taking up the work of those who came before us,â€ he says. â€œWe never knew when the tipping point would come, but we are now in a moment where there is a public consensus that America must address the legacy of her original sin in systemic racism.â€ At the same time, there appears to be flagging interest in white grievance. It's not just Confederate monuments that are coming down. A core political tactic that relied on coded racist appeals may also be starting to topple. In the 1960s the Republican Party quietly began its â€œSouthern Strategyâ€ of using terms like â€œforced busingâ€ and â€œstate's rightsâ€ to play on racial fears and win elections. Democrats have also used such appeals, but not to the extent Republicans have. But racial dog whistles just don't hunt like they used to. President Trump is offering proof. He'sopposing any effortby the US military to rename bases that bear the name of Confederate commanders. He also called Black Lives Matter a â€œsymbol of hate.â€ And as of nowhe's losing badlyto Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the polls. â€œWhen we look back, we may well realize that there was indeed one last presidential election that could be won on white racial resentment â€” but that election happened in 2016,â€ Paul Waldman said in a recent Washington Post column. Protesters in 2020, though, want more than an end to racist speech. Barber, for example, has helped launch aPoor People's Campaignand his group plans an array of activities around the Fourth of July this weekend. â€œWe can't get sidelined into little reforms around the edges,â€ Barber says. â€œThis isn't just about bringing down a flag or banning chokeholds. We are in a moment that demands a Third Reconstruction to guarantee freedom and equal justice. We must push to become the America that has never yet been.â€ That kind of America may seem far off right now. But we no longer have to look to the Founding Fathers to celebrate the spirit that makes this nation special. We can look to the faces of the millions of Americans who took to the streets this year to reimagine the nation. We can look to the nurse who takes our temperature, or the other essential and brave workers who drive buses, deliver groceries and restock store shelves. That's the paradox of this Fourth of July. It is an awful time to be an American. It is a great time to look forward to a New America. All the people who took to the streets this spring are living monuments to a New America – a land that never was, â€œand yet must be.â€",0.124,0.579,0.297,0.6486,0.13,0.768,0.103,-0.9974

Veterans,FOX,2023,Maureen Mackey,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/veterans-day-lessons-leadership-america-former-marine-mission,"This Veterans Day, four key lessons on leadership in America from a former Marine: 'Sense of mission'","In Crawford, Texas, Friday, Nov. 10, former President George W. Bush held his 9th Warrior Bike Ride for America's veterans and shared with Dr. Marc Siegel of Fox News the importance of staying positive. OnVeterans Dayeach year, the nation honors the more than 18 million Americans who have served our country. Services, parades, luncheons and other special events take place to acknowledge the sacrifices and service of our military. As one individual points out, the transition of veterans back into their communities andinto the workplaceremains a vital and ongoing step — with wide-reaching impacts. Andrew McClure, a managing director at Forgepoint Capital based in Silicon Valley, the largest and most active venture capital firm focused on cybersecurity, told Fox News Digital, ""Veterans are sought after by employers who value traits for which veterans are well-known: experience, dedication, discipline, initiative and demonstrated leadership skills. GEORGE W. BUSH DURING WARRIOR BIKE RIDE IN TEXAS FOR AMERICA'S VETERANS: 'LUCKY TO HAVE THEM AS CITIZENS' ""Those who have served in the U.S. armed forces bring a unique talent and sense of mission into the labor pool after they hang up the uniform."" A former Marinehimself, McClure said what he learned during his years in the service ""has not only made me a better citizen, but also a better business leader."" Members of U.S. Marine guards are shown folding their national flag during the closing ceremony of the annual joint U.S.-Philippines military exercise in Manila May 19, 2017.(Ted Aljibe/AFP via Getty Images) McClure served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. He led cross-functional teams in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa and Australia focused on signals intelligence and cyber operations. To this day, he remains active in the reserves, supporting the U.S. intelligence community. He serves on the board of directors at Constella Intelligence, Converge Insurance and other firms and is a graduate ofthe U.S. Naval Academywith a degree in astrophysics). He holds advanced degrees from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, MIT's Sloan School of Management and the Australian National University. VETERANS ARE VALUABLE IN TODAY'S JOB MARKET: 'HIGHLY ADAPTABLE TO CHANGE' This Veterans Day, McClure shared four tips and insights for successful leaders of any group, organization or company. McClure stressed that ""in the Marine Corps, officers eat last. The aphorism isn't a statement on etiquette, but rather a broader understanding thatservice-based leadershipinvolves prioritizing your organization's needs before your own. ""Whether the first to the field or the last to leave the office, servant leaders trade their comforts for the well-being of their team. In the process, they accrue loyalty and admiration for when it really matters."" While ""commanding obedience to orders is simple, true leadership inspires courage to charge a hill under fire,"" a former Marine said on Veterans Day.(Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) America's military veterans, he said, ""recognize a difference between formal authority and moral authority. One is characterized by the rank you wear or the title on your business card. The other is by the trust you earn by virtue of your performance, competence and rectitude."" And while ""commanding obedience to orders is simple — true leadership inspires courage to charge a hill under fire."" WITH THEIR MILITARY SON LOST TO SUICIDE, PARENTS SHARE A PATH TO HEALING — AND HELPING OTHERS McClure said in today's society and the world of work, ""imagine a store manager restocking shelves, a CEO fielding sales calls or a research physiciancontinuing to treat clinical patients. All three examples show the value of frontline feedback."" ""Does your organization,"" asked McClure, ""invest in people, train them for the full depth and responsibility of the job and support their independent judgment by devolving as much decision-making authority down to the lowest possible level?"" He said, in the Marines, ""mission rehearsals build pattern recognition — and case studies and after-action reviews provide learning opportunities for constant improvement."" True leaders, said a former Marine, should ""reward strong performance with the recognition it deserves. Few things damage morale more than seeing positive behavior going unnoticed or poor performance going uncorrected.""(iStock) So leaders of any type of organization should ""decentralize decision-making,"" he said. ""A common misperception of the military is that the highest-ranking officials make the most important decisions,"" said McClure. ""The exact opposite is true. More than any weapon platform, the secret strength ofthe U.S. armed forcesis the non-commissioned officer (NCO) corps, in which corporals and sergeants are empowered to make real-time decisions."" MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE AMERICAN LEGION, THEODORE ROOSEVELT JR., PRIVILEGED TO FIGHT AND TO SERVE And given that ""problems are recognized the quickest by those at the point of friction — and that speed is a weapon"" — any leader should remember that ""success is never yours alone but belongs to the team."" ""Marines know better than most the full weight of accountability."" He also recommended that leaders should ""reward strong performancewith the recognition it deserves."" Added McClure, ""Few things damage morale more than seeing positive behavior going unnoticed or poor performance going uncorrected."" Leaders of any organization or group — no matter its focus or mission — need to ""take responsibility for their actions."" Said McClure, ""Many industry leaders (and clearly politicians) like to proclaim, 'The buck stops here,' but are masters at shifting blame. Marines know better than most the full weight of accountability. ""Confident leaders are self-aware. They ask questions, but never the same ones twice. Self-introspection, humility and demonstrating willingness to learn can go a long way.""(Getty Images) ""They don't claim success as their own or pass off failure to others. They know how to handle, and never hide, bad news. If you were hired to do one thing and couldn't manage, resign."" HOMELESS VETERAN WALKS 30 MILES TO FIND A JOB: 'I'M A MAN ON A MISSION' He added that ""confident leaders are self-aware. They ask questions, but never the same ones twice. Self-introspection, humility and demonstrating willingness to learn can go a long way."" McClure said that part of setting high standards for teams is about encouraging initiative in others. ""Bonds built on pride of place create tenacious loyalty."" ""Marines have an exhortation: 'Message to Garcia,'"" he said. ""The allusion is to the 1899 essay on how individual initiative saved the day and won the Spanish-American War.  When said to another Marine, it simply means, 'Go figure it out.' Improvise, adapt and overcome. ""Fostering initiative is the key ingredient to creating a culture of ownership."" ""What practices, traditions and vocabulary are you forming at your organization to foster unity of effort so everyone keeps marching in the same direction?""(Fox News Digital) McClure's final insight is about the Marines' embrace of ""esprit de corps — a sense of unity, mission and close association through task and purpose."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP American Marines, he said, ""share common rituals, rites of passage and jargon. Bonds built on pride of place createtenacious loyalty.""

Veterans Day is set aside to honor and celebrate military veterans — anyone who has served in any branch of the United States Armed Forces. It is a federal holiday in the U.S. that deserves more attention than it gets. Patriots across the country celebrate it annually on Nov. 11 because on the 11th hour of the 11th day in the 11th month of 1918,World War Ihostilities ceased between the Allied Powers and Germany. VETERANS DAY VS MEMORIAL DAY: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? Originally known as Armistice Day, Nov. 11 was meant to celebrate world peace and the end of the first World War. In 1926, Congress officially recognized it with a resolution. Less than two decades later, World War II broke out and peace was no more.

The 5-foot-by-8-foot flags have been erected each year since 1990 and are also displayed on Memorial Day and Independence Day thanks to the help of volunteers, a mix of veterans and community members. And for most residents of Blairsville -- which boasts a population of roughly 3,500 people and is located approximately 40 miles east of Pittsburgh -- the display is personal, as the flags represent loved ones, family members and friends. VETERANS DAY 2020: DINING DEALS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL ""This is a small community. My father-in-law, and his brother, my wife's uncle ... they passed away and they're a part of the display. And even, unfortunately, friends of mine that I've grown up with have the display, and so on. So, I know quite a few of them now,â€ James Kissock, a member of the Blairsville Veterans Flag Committee, a group of community members and veterans from the local American Legion, told Fox News.

He now works with family members of the deceased veterans in arranging their display. Each flag has its own identifiable marker to represent a fallen service member, which includes the person's name and service dates, and can be located on a map placed near the entrance of Blairsville Cemetery. This year's Veterans Day display was erected on Nov. 7 and will remain until Nov. 14. CELEBRATE VETERANS DAY 2020 VIRTUALLY WITH THESE ONLINE EVENTS â€œThe bottom line is we all believe the same thing,â€ Kissock told Fox News. â€œIt's just the idea of displaying these deceased veterans and honoring their service and people will remember them â€¦ These are burial flags. So they're quite large and they're 20-feet apart and on 15-foot flagpoles. And when the wind blows, it's just amazing. It's beautiful.â€ The committee has received more than 900 flags donated by relatives of deceased veterans, Bill Swanson, commander of the American Legion Post 0407, told Fox News. The flags on display vary per holiday because the cemetery is unable to fit all of them at one time. All veterans memorialized by the flags are either buried within the cemetery or live within a certain region, he said. Swanson, 74, served with the U.S. Marines in the 1960s and said he had been involved with the flag display and the legion since 2008. Flags on display at Blairsville Cemetery, Blairsville, Penn.

And so we're out walking, and we were walking across the cemetery those years ago and the veterans were there putting up the flags. We said, 'Do you need any help?'â€ she told Fox News. â€œWell, here we are. We're still helping.â€ McAtee is the daughter of veterans and has two children who are in the military, she said.

Nonetheless, the community has come together to honor its own. â€œTypically, we would have a parade and a program at the Veterans Circle and the community band plays at the local high school. It's beautiful,â€ McAtee continued. But â€œthe flags are up. They're gorgeous.â€ Stephanie Pagones is a Digital Reporter for FOX Business and Fox News.

American service members, past and current, may hear ""Thank you for your service"" on Veterans Day, which is Nov. 11. Unsure exactly whatVeterans Dayis? Read on for a look at the holiday and the history of the occasion. ""While those who died are also remembered, Veterans Day is the day set aside to thank and honor allthose who servedhonorably in the military — in wartime or peacetime,"" the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) says on its website. VETERANS DAY IS NOT ALWAYS EASY FOR OUR HEROES – HERE'S WHAT TO SAY AND DO The holiday ""is largely intended to thank livingveterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated and to underscore the fact that all those who served — not only those who died — have sacrificed and done their duty,"" the site also says. Nov. 11 was originally commemorated as Armistice Day by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.(iStock) The roots of Veterans Day go back nearly 100 years. Fighting during World War I stopped on Nov. 11, 1918 due to an armistice between the Germans and the Allies, the VA website notes. Nov. 11 was originally commemorated as Armistice Day by then-President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. Congress passed a resolution in 1926 calling for Nov. 11 to be remembered each year ""with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations."" NY TEACHER, US COAST GUARD MEMBER WHO LOST AN EYE WON'T ALLOW 'FREAK ACCIDENT' TO DEFINE HIS LIFE In 1938, Armistice Day became alegal public holiday. Many American soldiers lost their lives during World War II and the Korean War. In the wake of these wars, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954. The first oneis correct. There is no apostrophe in Veterans Day. ""Veterans Day does not include an apostrophe but does include an 's' at the end of 'veterans' because it is not a day that 'belongs' to veterans — it is a day for honoring all veterans,"" the VA's website notes.

Since the American Revolution, Hispanics have been serving in the U.S. Armed Forces with distinction and bravery. Take, for instance, the story of Sgt. JosÃ© Lopez, who, on Dec. 17, 1944, single-handedly held off two Nazi units and killed over 35 Germans protecting his outnumbered company by manning a heavy machine gun. Or the last ""Ace in a Day"" of World War II, the Mexican-American 1st Lieutenant Oscar Perdomo, who earned the title when he recorded five kills on Aug. 13, 1945. Or the 65th Infantry Regiment - a.k.a., the ""Borinqueneers"" which was based in Puerto Rico. The unit fought in nine major campaigns from 1950 to 1953, earning 124 Silver Stars and four Distinguished Service Crosses. The unit was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor earlier this year. Some of their stories are surprising in more ways than one, like Cuban-born Loreta Janeta VelÃ¡zquez, who followed her husband into the Confederate Army during the Civil War but wound up becoming a spy for the Union side. And there are many trailblazers – like Lt. Al Cisneros became the first Latino pilot to serve the Navy's famed Blue Angels flight demonstration squad in 1975 and Gen. Richard E. Cavazos, a decorated platoon and company commander in the Korean War who was the The U.S. Army's first Hispanic four-star general. To date, 61 Hispanics have been awarded the Medal of Honor, 42 of them received the award posthumously, from the Civil War to the war in Afghanistan.

Smaller parades were held across the nation to honor Americans who have served in the U.S. military. The Veterans Day holiday began more than a century ago, albeit under a different name, as a celebration of the end of World War I. Over time its name and purpose evolved into a day of recognition forU.S. veteransofall warsas well as those currently serving in uniform. It's also day off for U.S. postal workers and other federal government employees, as well as many schoolchildren. Numerous stores and businesses offer giveaways and discounts. Here's a look at how the United States celebrates Veterans Day and how it started: It began asArmistice Dayto celebrate the agreement between the Allied nations and Germany to cease all fighting during World War I that took effect at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918. The U.S. marked its first Armistice Day under President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. Congress made Nov. 11 an official federal holiday in 1938. A holiday dedicated to those who fought in what had been known as â€œthe war to end all warsâ€ got a reevaluation after World War II. In 1954, Congress changed the name to Veterans Day, reflecting a broader purpose to honor veterans of all wars. Other changes weren't so well received, according tothe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' website.Federal Veterans Day observances were moved to Mondays in the early 1970s, causing confusion as some states stuck with the Nov. 11 date. In 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving federal observances back to Nov. 11. The U.S. has celebrated Veterans Day on that date ever since. Communities around the U.S. have held parades celebrating war veterans on Nov. 11 dating back to the first Armistice Day in 1919. The nation's largest Veterans Day parade is held in New York with a procession along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. According to the United War Veterans Council, which organizes the parade, an estimated 20,000 marchers were taking part in 2024. U.S. presidents lay a wreath during a ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. In remarks at the cemetery's memorial amphitheater Monday, Biden said it had been his life's honor to serve as commander in chief of â€œthe finest fighting force in the history of the world.â€ Other countries including the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia also honor veterans on or near Nov. 11. They call their day of commemoration Remembrance Day. While Veterans Day events tend to focus on giving thanks to all U.S. military veterans, both living and dead,Memorial Day observancestraditionally have been about memorializing those killed during wars. Memorial Day got its start after the Civil War, with the first national observance of what was then called Decoration Day on May 30, 1868. An organization of Union Army veterans called for decorating war graves with flowers. Since 1971, the U.S. has marked Memorial Day on the last Monday in May rather than on May 30. The resulting three-day weekend has led to some complaints that the day's true purpose of somber remembrance has been undermined by its more leisurely recognition as the unofficial start of summer. Because it's a federal holiday, the U.S. Postal Service doesn't deliver the mail on Veterans Day. Federal courts and other government offices are closed as well. Most banks in the U.S. take the day off, as do many public schools. The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaqremain open, though bond markets are closed. Though some private businesses observe Veterans Day, most retailers remain open, with many offering special deals. Many restaurants offer free meals to veterans and current members of the military, who also benefit from Veterans Day discounts from retailers. Some zoos and museums waive admission, while certain shops give away haircuts and automobile oil changes, according to a list compiled by theDepartment of Veterans Affairs.",0.0,0.652,0.348,0.7506,0.087,0.805,0.108,0.9001

Dozens gathered on Veterans Day at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park in Maryland's Dorcester County for a formal ceremony making Tubman a one-star brigadier general in the state's National Guard. Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman's home state but for all of the U.S. â€œToday, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran,â€ Moore said. â€œToday we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.â€ Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849 and settled in Philadelphia. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina. Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said. â€œShe knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion's den,â€ Moore siad. â€œShe knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.â€ The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt. Wyatt hailed her aunt's legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other servicemember. â€œAunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others,â€ Wyatt said. â€œShe is a selfless person.â€ Tubman's status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist to make a14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statueto go on display next year.

Veterans,CNN,2024,Dawn Sawyer,https://www.cnn.com/harriet-tubman-veterans-day-military-service/index.html,Harriet Tubman honored for her military service on Veterans Day nearly 160 years later,"A scout. A spy. A nurse. An advocate. These were just a few of the titles used to describe a renowned freedom fighter and former enslaved woman who spent her life fighting for others at a commissioning ceremony in Maryland. The Maryland National Guard and Gov. Wes Moore posthumously commissioned Harriet Tubman as a one-star general in the Maryland Army National Guard on Monday. The ceremony, commemorating her service to the Union Army during the Civil War, was held near her birthplace at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park Visitor Center. â€œThis is a person who was one of the greatest Marylanders we've ever known, and someone who was willing to risk her own freedom, her own safety, her own life in order to save others. That is patriotism. That is heroism,â€ said Moore, acknowledging the importance of honoring Tubman on Veterans Day. John A. Andrews, the governor of Massachusetts at the time of the Civil War, recruited Tubman to the Union Army shortly after the war began. Tubman was the first African American woman to serve in combat for the US military. She first served as a liaison between Union commanders and escaping slaves, helping to recruit them into the military. She then worked as both a nurse and a spy, commanding her own group of spies and leading an expedition that led to the freedom of over 700 slaves. After the war ended, Tubman was denied military benefits by the USgovernment. She received a widow's pension more than 20 years later for the military service of her second husband. Maj. Gen. Janeen L. Birckhead, the commanding officer for the Maryland National Guard, hosted the ceremony to officially recognize Tubman's military service, commissioning her as a brigadier general. â€œOn behalf of the Maryland National Guard, I am proud to call Brig. Gen. Harriet Tubman among the best of us,â€ said Birckhead. â€œWith courage and selflessness, Harriet Tubman nobly advanced the survival of the Union and the proposition that all people are created equal.â€ The decision won unanimous support from both chambers of the Maryland General Assembly, state delegate Edith J. Patterson explained. Following speeches from political leaders, Birckhead placed the symbolic rank around the neck of Tina Wyatt, the three-time great grandniece of Tubman. â€œShe came into the Civil War, into the bowels of slavery, after having freed herself to be able to free others, and to be able to fight for the Unionâ€¦ but mostly to free the enslaved that were there and then to let them fight,â€ Wyatt said as she accepted the honor. Born into chattel slavery in 1820 as Araminta â€œMintyâ€ Ross, Tubman was raised on a plantation in Dorchester County, Maryland. She was one of 11 children. As a five-year-old child, she was rented out to a neighboring family. When she was 12, Tubman was hit in the head with a heavy metal weight while trying to aid a fleeing slave. The injury caused her to have sleeping spells for the rest of her life, and episodes where she would drop into unconsciousness without warning. Tubman decided she would escape around 1850, after learning she and two of her brothers were to be sold. The siblings left together, but, fearful of what would happen if they were caught, her brothers turned back. Tubman continued the journey to Philadelphia alone, according to an 1886 biography by Sarah Bradford. In 1850, Tubman began her famous work with the Underground Railroad, first organizing the escape of her sister Mary Ann and her family. In 1857, Tubman returned to Maryland and freed her parents. Tubman is said to have made at least 17 additional trips south during her lifetime. Tubman became a legend to many of the people who heard of her journeys, becoming known as the Moses of her time. Whispers of a mysterious Moses spread among plantation owners, who offered large rewards for her capture. Tubman made her last trip to Maryland in November 1860, around the time that Abraham Lincoln was elected president. She died in 1913 at the age of 92. In2016, US Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew announced plans to have a portrait of Tubman featured on the front of the $20 bill. In 2021, the Biden administration said it was â€œexploring ways to speed upâ€ the release of$20 bills featuring the abolitionistafter theTrump administration delayed the movefirst initiated by President Barack Obama.

That's the guidance from celebrity chef Robert Irvine whoruns his own foundation for service members.Irvine is a veteran of the British Royal Navy and hosts his own show on Food Network. (Food Network and CNN are both divisions of Warner Bros. Discovery.) He suggests several ways to assist veterans throughout the year. Many military members and veterans rely on food banks,since as many as one in four active duty men and women are food insecure. About one in five military and veteran families strugglewith food insecurity. Irvine says volunteering in a food bank – and making the time while you're there to sit down and actually talk to a veteran – is a great way to thank people for their service. â€œWhen you put a meal in front of somebody, it drops the barriers down,â€ he says. Other places where you can have one-on-one conservations with vets include churches and VA hospitals. Irvine says you could volunteer at the USO or even just sit in the lobby of a VA hospital and offer to talk to anyone who might be lonely. You could even just google â€œveteran groups in my areaâ€ and offer to volunteer with them. One-on-one conversations are among the best gifts you can give someone who served. â€œIt's human nature to ask questions. Even if you're not so good at it, most people will happily talk to you,â€ Irvine says. â€œI think that's what we crave the most. Just conversation. Putting down the phones. When you make friends, you have someone to share [your] feelings with.â€ The celebrity chef says after years of working with veterans, his biggest message is to get them out of their own space, â€œwhich in turn gets them out of their own heads.â€ Irvine often posts on social media, or reaches out to vets he knows, just to say â€œHey, how are you doing?â€ When he can meet them in person, Irvine likes to get vets into the gym, feed them, or even teach them how to cook. Food is a common theme. â€œFlorida just had two hurricanes. If you can cook a meal and deliver it,â€ that can be so helpful he says. â€œIf it's a homeless veteran, buy him a jacket, socks, shoes,â€ he says. Employers can help veterans by hiring them, and if possible, even adding them to their boards of directors. â€œThe way we're trained in the military is to problem-solve,â€ points out Irvine. Veterans' leadership skills make them useful to almost every business, he says. â€œI can tell you that I have veterans in my company. Why wouldn't I have somebody like that advising me? It's a no-brainer.â€ You may have to seek them out, Irvine warns, since they typically don't want to ask for help. â€œVeterans don't want a hand out. They want a hand up,â€ he says. â€œWe don't join the military to make money. We do it because it's patriotic.â€ Everyone seems to remember vets on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, he says, but â€œwhat about the other days of the year?â€ â€œDon't care for a minute, care forever. Check on them,â€ says Irvine. â€œIt starts with a meal, a hot cup of coffee and an ear.â€",0.0,0.748,0.252,0.4019,0.04,0.892,0.068,0.8495

Veterans,CNN,2022,Mike Valerio,https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/us/veterans-day-history-flight-ctrp/index.html,"Veterans and scientists fulfill 'no man left behind,' returning long-lost American remains from lonely Pacific WWII battlefield","On a remote Pacific sandbar, replete with the ravages of war, a small group of veterans, volunteers and archeologists are doing their best to keep the enduring promise of â€œno man left behind.â€ According to the Department of Defense, nearly half of the known American casualties from the Battle of Tarawa were never recovered. Approximately 1,000 Marines and sailors lost their lives on the small sandbar November 20-23, 1943, in the US military's first offensive of the war in the central Pacific. The graves of more than 30 Marines and sailors killed in bloody World War II battle have been found Graves remained lost for decades, Pentagon historians write, because of bad record keeping, poor memories, and in some instances, war infrastructure inadvertently built over service members' unmarked final resting places. DOD records show by 1950, a military board declared hundreds of Americans who fought and died on the island â€œnon-recoverable,â€ leaving families without words, images or ideas of where the young men rested. After excavation efforts paused during the pandemic, teams will return to the lonely atoll, with the goal of returning as many remains of US service members as they can. â€œThis is not a normal thing for somebody to be doing,â€ said Paul Schwimmer, a retired US Army Green Beret who searches for American remains with the non-profit group,History Flight, who added a new chapter of history is unfolding along the isolated and idyllic shore. â€œDon't tell us these men are not recoverable, give us a chance to go after them.â€ Government figures show 72,627 Americans are currently classified as missing in action from World War II. There are more US troops missing from 1941-1945, than from all other wars with US involvement combined. In 2003, commercial pilot and World War II history aficionado Mark Noah founded History Flight. The group's initial aim was to preserve American aviation history, an outgrowth of Noah's love of antiquity, aircraft and his family tradition of scholarship. An American family finds closure as a WWII hero finally comes home â€œMy father was a diplomat for the State Department, a Harvard and MIT-trained sinologist,â€ Noah said in an interview with CNN. â€œI was born in China, where my dad was posted, and I was able to see the lingering effects of World War II up close. That was the beginning of a fascination with the Second World War.â€ Noah relates the multitude of missing service members to those missing in his own life. â€œFour of my close friends in Beijing disappeared during Tiananmen Square,â€ Noah said. â€œAnd I've always wondered where they fell into, this deep void, the unknown. And at a subconscious level, it's one of the reasons why I'm driven to find our missing Americans, especially when we know where they are, on an island.â€ Noah said 2008 was a turning point, when History Flight's mission changed from aviation to recovery missions. â€œI was doing research about a missing airplane that crashed in the lagoon of Tarawa, and I was shocked at just how many people were missing on this small island,â€ Noah said. â€œSo, I self-funded what became our first Tarawa excavation, and with all of those people missing in such a small place, we chose Tarawa because we thought we could deliver a project with a high probability of success.â€ The cost was $25,000, with a team of 10 people. A cadre of veterans, scientists and students interviewed residents who found bones underneath their homes. The non-profit also used ground-penetrating radar on the atoll, ultimately finding scores of American graves buried within a working commercial seaport. In the decade since its first dig, History Flight has led to the identification of 96 American service members killed on Tarawa, according to the branch of the Pentagon charged with finding US military remains, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. â€œThat number undoubtedly will go up,â€ agency spokesperson Johnie Webb said. In a cozy East Wenatchee, Washington, living room, twins Don and David McCannel held the crumbling and corroded helmet buried with their uncle, Gunnery Sgt. Arthur B. Summers, a Tarawa Marine once considered missing in action. Summers' near-complete skeleton is among the latest remains discovered by History Flight. His return home for burial in America followed a now familiar ritual of repatriation: Delicately-handled bones are discovered on Tarawa, then flown to the US for positive identification, and finally, re-buried with full military honors. The McCannel twins are now 76 years old, born three years after a telegram told their mother Summers was killed in action, his body missing on a faraway Pacific island. â€œMy most vivid memory is, when I was about 10 years old, my mother said to me, 'my brother was killed in Tarawa and his body was never recovered,'â€ David McCannel described in an interview. â€œShe didn't cry. She just said he's gone forever.â€ 10 ways to honor veterans beyond Veterans Day Schwimmer, the retired Green Beret with History Flight, said he was within the Tarawa excavation site when Summers' remains were discovered in 2019, and attended Summers' Washington funeral in August 2022. â€œTo see this, to look over my shoulder, to put my hand on the casket and say, 'Hey bud, I saw you in 2019. I took you from Tarawa to here.' For me, that's great,â€ Schwimmer said. â€œNow, put me back on an airplane, get me in the field, I got work to do.â€ Summers was killed on November 23, 1943, the final day of fighting on the island, and according to military records, the day Summers' second enlistment extension was to expire. â€œI thank them eternally, and forever,â€ Don McCannel said of History Flight and those responsible for Summers' identification. â€œMy uncle Arthur did his duty, and these men and women today did theirs, truly.â€ The Pentagon agency tasked with finding the remains of an astounding 81,500 Americans missing since World War I, contracts Tarawa excavation work with History Flight. But the agency itself is solely responsible for the process of DNA identification. There is no margin for error. Scientists and military personnel from Hawaii, Nebraska and Delaware finish the process of uniting stories, names, and family histories with the skeletal remains of US troops. Dr. John Byrd, the agency's laboratory director, explained the challenges of dealing with DNA from that era. â€œThey're highly degraded, there's only a tiny amount of DNA left in there at all. And our DNA lab is the best in the world at extracting what little bit is left in there.â€ Byrd said the average time to identify an individual is 2.5 years, but can be as quickly as two weeks. â€œWhen none of the stars are aligned, it can take several years. We have ID's we've made after more than 10 years, when we finally got enough evidence together to be able to prove the identity.â€ For Summers' remains, delivered to the agency's Pearl Harbor laboratory in July 2019, the DOD agency was able to make a positive DNA identification in a matter of months, on October 17, 2019. First, remains arrive at an agency laboratory in Honolulu, or Omaha, Nebraska. â€œThey come from a variety of sources, from our own excavations, and from excavations from our partners â€¦ We also do a lot of disinterments of unknown remains, right from our national cemeteries,â€ Byrd explained. Next, as the remains are assigned to evidence managers, scientists determine which tests are needed to identify the remains. The majority will involve DNA testing, but other methods, such as dental records, can be used. World War II Marine, missing for more than 70 years, buried in Arlington DNA testing and other identification work then begins. Samples are sent to the Armed Forces DNA Identification Lab in Dover, Delaware, and a type of identification known as stable isotope analysis can also be performed at the agency's Pearl Harbor lab. The isotope testing is used to trace remains' geographic origin. Finally, test results are evaluated, and perhaps even more testing is needed. â€œYou love it when the test results come back in, and they clearly direct you to one individual that these remains should be,â€ Byrd said. â€œBut we also sometimes get results that aren't strong enough to point to one person only. And then we have to find another way to try to resolve the case other than the testing we did in the first round â€¦ that is one of the most difficult steps for many of our cases.â€ History Flight estimates their Tarawa excavation efforts are halfway finished. â€œWe believe about 250 sets of remains can still be found, and we want to keep going,â€ History Flight founder Mark Noah said. Get it straight: The difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day The non-profit's vice president, retired U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Maj. Justin LeHew, is currently walking across America, from Boston to Newport, Oregon, to donations for the group's ongoing work in the Pacific. LeHew served in the 2nd Marine Division, the same (albeit modern day) combat element which engaged in the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943. His previous chapter of military service includes receiving the Navy Cross, awarded for his 2003 role in rescuing ambushed soldiers in Iraq, including Pfc. Jessica Lynch. â€œTeam members are putting in the work for the missing,â€ LeHew wrote on Facebook, as his walk on U.S. Highway 20, America's longest road, approached Yellowstone National Park. â€œThis specific road was selected to highlight the long journey home that over 81,000 missing U.S. Servicemembers have been trying to make since World War II,â€ LeHew said. â€œWe know that we can fulfill this promise of 'no one left behind' on Tarawa,â€ Noah added. â€œWe simply need people to know we're there, to know about us, put the financial resources in place, and help us carry on this sacred mission.â€",0.315,0.56,0.125,-0.5267,0.076,0.871,0.052,-0.9809

During a speech in Arlington, Biden said having served is â€œa badge of courage that unites across all ages, regardless of background – because to be a veteran is to have endured and survived challenges most Americans will never know.â€ â€œYou've come through the trials and testing, braved dangers and deprivations, faced down tragic realities of war and death. You've done it for us. You've done it for America. To defend and serve American values. To protect our country and our Constitution against all enemies. And to lay a stronger, more secure foundation on which future generations can continue to build a more perfect union,â€ the President continued. Related articleVeterans exposed to burn pits will get expanded health care support, White House says â€œYou are the very spine of America – not just the backbone, the spine of this country,â€ Biden said. â€œAnd all of us owe you. And so on Veterans Day and every day, we honor that great debt and recommit ourselves to keeping our sacred obligation as a nation to honor what you've done.â€ The President also recalled the experience of his late son, Beau, deploying to Iraq, telling the audience, â€œfor me and for Jill and for the entire Biden family, it's personal.â€ â€œJill and I learned what it meant to pray every day for the safe return of someone you love. So many of you have done that. Our grandkids learned what it meant to have their dad overseas in a war zone instead of back at home for a year, tucking them into bed reading that story every night. Thousands of Americans, tens of thousands, have had that experience,â€ Biden said. The commander-in-chief, during his speech, honored three veterans who died in recent weeks:Gen. Colin Powell,Sen. Max Cleland andGen. Ray Odierno, saying they â€œinspired generation after generation of Americans to step forward to defend our nationâ€. The President specifically noted the sacrifice of those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, including those who died and those who returned with â€œpsychological wounds of warâ€ and other medical issues. â€œWe're going to work with Congress – Republicans and Democrats – to make sure our veterans receive the world-class benefits that they've earned. â€¦ That means expanding presumptive conditions like toxic exposure to particulate matter, including Agent Orange and burn pits. We're going to keep pushing on this front to be more nimble and responsive, reviewing all the data and evidence to determine additional presumptive conditions that make sure our veterans don't have to wait to get the care they need,â€ he said. Biden also made a personal plea to those who may be experiencing mental health struggles in the wake of their service, and he also pledged that his administration was focused on â€œmaking sure the growing population of women and LGBTQ+ veterans receive appropriate services and support.â€ Earlier Thursday morning, the President hosted veterans and members of the military community at the White House and participated in a wreath-laying ceremony on the centennial anniversary of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Approximately 50 invited guests, including Cabinet secretaries, senior administration officials, members of Congress, military representatives, veterans and their families were present for the wreath-laying ceremony. On Tuesday, Bidenannounceda new military and veteran suicide prevention strategy that includes promoting safe firearms storage and outlining best practices for firearm dealers. And earlier Thursday, the Biden administrationannounceda series of new support options for veterans who had been exposed to â€œcontaminants and environmental hazards,â€ such as burn pits, while serving. Burn pits were used to incinerate all sorts of waste, hazardous material and chemical compounds at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. Eighty-six percent of post-9/11 veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan say they were exposed to burn pits, according to a 2020 survey by the nonprofit Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. The steps, which the White House detailed in a fact sheet, seek to â€œimprove our understanding of the health effects of military-related exposures, educate providers and veterans about these exposures, and provide timelier access to health services and benefits for individuals who were exposed.â€ Veterans advocate Jeremy Butler called the White House announcement a â€œnice first stepâ€ but expressed criticism that there was more to be done at a congressional level to protect veterans, particularly those impacted with respiratory responses to â€œburn pitsâ€ while serving. â€œThe reality is this is a very nice first step, but there's a lot more that needs to be done. This is a good step by the administration,â€ Butler said in an interview on CNN's â€œNew Dayâ€ Thursday.

Across the nation this Veterans Day, we honor the service, sacrifice and commitment of those men and women who have worn the cloth of this great nation. If you believe as I do that there is a desire in every human heart to live in freedom, then this day is a special day. For 244 years, American heroes have built a Navy that supports and defends the nation we are today – a country that has been blessed with unprecedented freedom, security and prosperity. While our ships, submarines and aircraft are made of steel, it is the sailors who give our Navy its lifeblood. Among the heroes we should remember this Veterans Day is Cmdr. Ernest Evans, who chose to sail USS Johnston into harm's way during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Sea in 1944. Despite the superior Japanese force of battleships, heavy cruisers and destroyers, Johnston's actions ultimately crippled the Imperial Japanese Navy. Evans, who died in action, wasposthumously awardedthe Medal of Honor. Related articleA WWII veteran got his high school diploma at 95 We should also remember sailors likeGunner's Mate Third Class Paul Carr, who, during the same naval battle, manned the last operational gun mount aboard USS Samuel B. Roberts. Even after an explosion grievously wounded him, Carr continued in a desperate attempt to load and fire the last remaining rounds in the ship's magazine, and was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. The ferocity of the American attack at Leyte Gulf ultimately spelled the collapse of the Imperial Japanese Navy and cemented American naval supremacy in the Pacific during World War II. With the valiant efforts of Evans, Carr and countless others at Leyte Gulf, they showed that even the smallest ships in the US Navy could fight well above their weight class. Today and every day, we honor the millions of sailors who have gone before us to ensure that, if called to fight, the US Navy is so utterly dominant that we do not have to rely on sacrifices like the ones these heroic men made during World War II. While it is vitally important to remember our past, the Navy's future is also on my mind. Naval warfare is undergoing a rapid transition, which demands integration between each of our fleets. We are adopting this transition with urgency. Our Navy will deliver a combat credible maritime force ready to conduct prompt and sustained combat operations at sea. Together with the United States Marine Corps, our Navy is the bedrock of integrated American naval power.

We facilitate this prosperity – at home and abroad – by ensuring peace, stability and security. That is what your Navy does and what we will continue to do for generations to come. Mission One for every sailor – uniformed and civilian, active and reserve – must be the operational readiness of today's Navy. We must also be committed to training, maintenance and modernization, which will ensure a ready Navy for tomorrow.

MLK,WSJ,2024,Nneka M. Okona,https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/martin-luther-king-jr-atlanta-neighborhood-walking-tour-3518cfc9,Searching for Martin Luther King Jr.’s Past in His Old Atlanta Neighborhood,"A room at the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel at Morehouse College. I began my trip to the neighborhood at the visitor center of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, a collection of preserved sites, including King’s birth home, the fire station that served Sweet Auburn and Ebenezer Baptist Church where he preached. Despite King’s tragic end, a reality that always hung over this neighborhood for me as a child, I immediately felt a sense of hope on entering the visitor center. The National Park Service combined these sites under a single administrative umbrella and declared it a National Historical Park in 2018, building a cohesive tribute out of the scattered sites. Park rangers milled about directing foot traffic, passing out maps and answering questions. At an exhibition called “Courage to Lead,” I followed “Freedom Road,” a walkway that chronicled, year by year, King’s evolution from an impassioned youth in Atlanta to civil rights leader. I already knew much of the history, but the exhibit served as a handy refresher. Outside the visitor center, I strolled into the “I Have A Dream” World Peace Rose Garden, one of a handful of World Peace Rose Gardens scattered around the world. I was taken by the way the sun beamed down on the few flowers that had survived the winter chill. Across the street is Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King became a co-pastor with his father in 1960. Today, visitors are encouraged to start in Fellowship Hall, the basement-level auditorium restored to resemble its 1960s incarnation, down to the furniture clustered around the altar. In a looping video, Christine King Farris, the activist’s late sister, explains how pivotal the church was to her family. Upstairs, in what is now called the Heritage Sanctuary, I took a seat in one of the pews and admired the collection of Southern Baptist relics: handcrafted chairs for the pastors, an organ, stained glass windows. I could easily imagine King comforting a crowd in a time of collective grief. As in so much of this neighborhood, Ebenezer’s legacy is a living one: Regular services take place in a newer building next door. I stopped in front of the nearby Prince Hall Masonic Grand Lodge, which, historical markers noted, housed the headquarters of Atlanta’s Prince Hall branch of the North American Freemasons, the largest and oldest African-American fraternal order in the country. Offices for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which King oversaw as president from 1957 until his death in 1968, had also found a home in this building. A hundred feet down the street, that activism work continues at the current SCLC National Headquarters, which opened in 2007. Continuing my stroll, I spotted under an otherwise mundane overpass a 2020 mural that portrayed landmarks of the neighborhood, including the Yates and Milton Drugstore and Big Bethel A.M.E. Church, as they once were. As I walked farther from what street signs called the “King Historic District,” I noticed vacant storefronts alongside icons of the neighborhood like Sweet Auburn Bread Company. Ironically, the very overpass that hung over the commemorative mural—the Downtown Connector bypass on Auburn Avenue, completed in the 1960s—cut through the neighborhood, decimating the sort of local businesses the mural honors. In some ways, the area has never recovered. In 1980, hoping to restore the area to its former glory, Coretta Scott King led the formation of the Historic District Development Corporation. As with so many neighborhoods hurt by shortsighted development, the restoration efforts remain an uphill slog. In 2006, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation listed Sweet Auburn Historic District as a “Place in Peril.” Tucking my complex feelings about Sweet Auburn away, I looped back around to the Martin Luther King Jr.Birth Home. King spent the first 12 years of his life in this modest Queen Anne-style house painted in soft yellows with brown accents. It’s closed for renovations until the fall of 2025 but even a glimpse from the street can be transporting. Approaching the nearby King Center, a nonprofit organization founded by Coretta Scott King, I heard the gentle purring of water before I saw its source—a reflecting pool tiled in blue that matched the color of the winter sky. The pool led the eye toward a marble tomb: King and his wife’s final resting place. After I’d spent a full day exploring King’s beloved neighborhood, my hunger announced itself. While I had plenty to choose from in Sweet Auburn proper (try Mangos Caribbean Restaurant for its jerk chicken), to find one of King’s most frequent haunts, I needed to detour away from Auburn Ave. I headed to the West End, home to King’s alma mater Morehouse College. Years ago, Busy Bee’s owner Tracy Gates told me that King had been a regular here, pointing out the corner where he’d sit in his favorite booth and order pecan pie, often in the company of other civil rights leaders. These days, Busy Bee is takeout only and I opted for peach cobbler instead of the reverend’s favorite. I ate it in my car, watching the city hum around me, as the day’s light began to fade.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.862,0.108,0.9972
MLK,WSJ,2023,Rodney Stevens,https://www.wsj.com/articles/martin-luther-king-would-choose-reflection-over-intersectionality-discrimination-gender-race-sexual-orientation-11673645591,Martin Luther King Would Choose Reflection Over ‘Intersectionality’,"If the message of ‘antiracism’ is so important, why is it shrouded in impenetrable jargon? What in the world is “intersectionality”? Womankind Worldwide, a British organization, defines it as follows: “Intersectionality is the acknowledgement that everyone has their own unique experiences of discrimination and oppression and we must consider everything and anything that can marginalize people—gender, race, class, sexual orientation, physical ability, etc.” Google has an “intersectional workforce” page counting its employees by race and sex. I’m black and in my 60s and don’t feel the need for an “intersectional” coming out. The authors of a 2013 academic article, “Toward a Field of Intersectional Studies,” inform us: “Both in its earliest articulations and in its subsequent travels, praxis has been a key site of intersectional critique and intervention.” Compare all this verbosity with “I am the man, I suffered, I was there.” In “Giovanni’s Room” (1955), James Baldwin borrows that epigraph from Walt Whitman. Baldwin wasn’t being theoretical or intersectional in the least. His words brim with substance and resonance, given that he was writing about same-sex love. Also, refreshingly, the novel doesn’t concern itself with race at all. Recently I was browsing my local Barnes & Noble and happened on “The Disordered Cosmos: A Journey Into Dark Matter, Spacetime and Dreams Deferred.” The author, Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, is a star cosmologist and physicist and assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire. Many of the essays in the book aren’t easy reading. On a website biography, Ms. Prescod-Weinstein describes her “focus on Black feminism-grounded social epistemology which explores the impact of the presence of minoritized people in STEM,” and says she is a “pansexual agender cissex woman.” Other than “woman,” I don’t know what that means. I was able to fathom that she feels white “intellectual colonialism” prevents women and people of color from being fully accepted into university science programs. Yet Ms. Prescod-Weinstein herself seems to refute that claim. The polysyllabic antiracist talk keeps proliferating. Phillipe Copeland, one of whose titles is assistant director of narrative at the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, writes: “Belief and value systems and narratives that rationalize and normalize racial oligarchy must be exposed and countered.” He could have simply said that racial discrimination mustn’t be tolerated. Skyhorse Publishing advertises “Power: The Rise of Black Women in America” by Charity C. Elder as “an incisive disquisition on Black womanhood weaving theoretical frameworks of history and sociology with poignant interviews . . . ethnographic observations . . . and the author’s lived experiences.” Given the supposed importance of their messages, why are racial “thought leaders” and ideologues intent on confounding their readers and listeners with impenetrable jargon? Why not strive for elegance and illumination? Perhaps they want to appear imposing—a kind of verbal bullying. If you want to find the truth about race relations or anything else, a better approach is reflection, which the Collins Dictionary defines as “careful thought about a particular subject.” When we reflect, we search within ourselves and by ourselves. We can deliberate on any matter and think any thought we choose. In due course, the answers will reveal themselves.The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. often went on retreats to reflect. One of his favorite places was the Penn Center, that historic African-American cultural and educational center on St. Helena Island, S.C. In 1966 he was there with, among others, Joan Baez and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Guests and staff often respectfully asked him life-related questions. At one point, the New York Times reported, he smiled and said, “I am still searching myself, I don’t have all the answers.” King was reflecting. You should too. The racial equity specialists can’t touch you.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.017,0.901,0.082,0.9865

The leaders of the march, set to take place on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, are urging people to call on Congress to enact changes to elections law nationwide, rather than honoring Dr. King with celebrations on the federal holiday that marks his birthday. They also said they want to see the Senate change filibuster rules to allow Democrats to enact the legislation with a simple majority rather than with a 60-vote threshold. That goal now seems unlikely after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) said Thursday she wouldn’t support making a rule change. Without her vote, Democrats lack the votes to make any adjustments to the filibuster. “History will remember Sen. Sinema unkindly,” said Martin Luther King III, chairman of the Drum Major Institute, a nonprofit founded by Dr. King. “She’s siding with the legacy of Bull Connor and George Wallace instead of the legacy of my father and all those who fought to make real our democracy.” Ms. Sinema said she continues to support the elections bills. “But I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country,” the Democrat said on the Senate floor Thursday. Despite the setback, the King family, along with other civil-rights leaders and voting-rights advocates, will continue with their plans for the weekend. The mobilizations led by the King family will begin in Arizona this Saturday, to mark Dr. King’s actual birthdate. The King family then plans to lead the march across the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge in Washington on Monday. The Democratic-led House on Thursday passed a new elections bill to send to the Senate. That vote, expected in coming days, would be subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. Democrats have proposed eliminating the requirement or carving out an exemption for voting-rights bills. The party needs 50 senators to agree to change the filibuster rules, which would allow Vice President Kamala Harris to cast the tie-breaking vote. President Biden has argued that new elections laws are needed because recent Republican-backed state measures threaten access to the polls, particularly for nonwhite voters. Republicans said that the voting-rights package amounted to federal overreach, and that Democrats were mischaracterizing the laws passed by GOP-led states in the wake of the 2020 election. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called the remarks made by Mr. Biden divisive. “This whole display is the best possible argument for preserving the Senate rules that extend deliberation, force bipartisan compromise and let cooler heads prevail,” Mr. McConnell said in a Senate floor speech Wednesday, referring to Mr. Biden’s remarks.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.032,0.905,0.063,0.9153
MLK,WSJ,2021,Robert L. Woodson Sr,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-left-hijacked-civil-rights-11610748711,How the Left Hijacked Civil Rights,"The civil-rights movement, led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., helped deliver America from the historic sins of slavery and Jim Crow by forcing the nation to confront the full humanity of its black citizens. King’s words and actions glorified America by transfiguring its racial wound and revealing its redemptive promise. Yet today many black leaders have lost sight of King altogether and are aiding and abetting the crucifixion of their own people. Rather than hope, they see despair; rather than the Easter Sunday of true liberation, they offer the bleak Good Friday of never-ending misery. The history of black American responses to slavery and Jim Crow generally followed three paths. They were hotly debated, but all emphasized human agency, sought liberation, and rejected despair. First, there were the recolonization or “back to Africa” movements championed by the likes of Marcus Garvey. These movements sought an exit from America. Second, there were the insurrectionists of the 19th century, who believed that black Americans should engage in armed rebellion or vocal opposition so that they might find a home in this country. Here lie Nat Turner and, later, W.E.B. Du Bois. They wanted to have their resistant voice heard in America. Third, there were accommodationist movements of the sort undertaken by Booker T. Washington, who thought that loyalty to America was the best course. Exit, voice, loyalty—however different these strategies were, each supposed that human agency mattered, that oppression wasn’t destiny. That is why, even amid great struggle, black Americans responded by building their own institutions and businesses. Great universities, medical schools, hotels, restaurants, movie companies and even a flight school sprung up. All of this was self-financed—and made possible by two-parent families, churches and other cultural institutions that provided shelter against the outside storm of racism. In the 20th century, that same creative conflict between these three schools of thought reappeared. Debaters included the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Black Panther Party and the Republic of New Africa, which sought to establish a separate black state within our borders as an exit strategy. King offered an inspiring combination of the strategies of loyalty and voice. In 1960, when students in Greensboro, N.C., became frustrated with the slow pace of legal action favored by Thurgood Marshall, King was sent to discourage them from engaging in civil disobedience. The students told King to lead, follow or get out of the way. They were determined to liberate themselves. They understood the difficulties and were undeterred by the obstacles. Like King, they were willing to persevere toward justice even when it was inconvenient, and to suffer the consequences of their actions. Hope, not hopelessness, animated all that they did. King paid a heavy personal price for his hope that America was redeemable. Twice his home was bombed; once, his wife and daughter were nearly killed. Surrounded by hundreds of angry, armed black men after that bombing, he discouraged retaliatory violence. He was assaulted several times, and jailed as well, but he remained steadfast in his commitment to nonviolence. He united black Americans behind the proposition that racism is evil in itself, not simply because white people visited it upon blacks, and that all must unite to combat evil. He warned us about the self-destructive path of violence, not only for blacks but for the whole nation. One of the original arguments to justify slavery was that blacks were morally inferior and thus incapable of self-government. John C. Calhoun famously asserted: “There is no instance of any civilized colored race of any shade being found equal to the establishment and maintenance of free government.” Black efforts at self-liberation in the 19th and 20th centuries were based on the opposite assumption. Today many black leaders defer to angry white progressives who make the same arguments about blacks’ lack of moral agency, reject the country’s founding principles, and seek to undermine its institutions. For months, the radical left has been exploiting the country’s genuine concern for fairness to keep blacks in a constant state of agitation, anger and grievance, urging them toward behavior that lives down to the slanderous stereotypes of white supremacists. The leaders of these movements insist that every inequity suffered by blacks is caused by institutional and structural racism, that they have no power to liberate themselves, and that they will remain oppressed until white people change. Even to raise the issue of what role self-determination plays for blacks earns you the label of “racist.” Civil-rights organizations and their leadership, as well as the Congressional Black Caucus, need to wake up before it’s too late. A faction of black leaders has been silent about, or complicit in, the takeover of the civil-rights movement by the radical left. The effect of this is not to glorify black achievement but to crucify low-income blacks, who are represented in national media outlets by their worst-behaved members, and bear the brunt of the attacks by the woke radical left on the cities where they live. “Justice” for black America cannot be achieved by framing it solely through the distorted lens of the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others in fatal police encounters. For every unarmed black American killed by the police, hundreds are killed in neighborhood homicides. Those who call for the defunding of police departments, such as leaders of the official Black Lives Matter organization, are silent about this inconvenient truth. They have a narrative and cannot let the facts get in the way. Their story is that the whole of American history is stained and the whole of America must be overthrown. When citizens declare that they support Black Lives Matter, do they share its opposition to the nuclear family, its objective of abolishing the police, and its view that the Christian cross is a symbol of white supremacy? These positions of the organization—language that has largely been scrubbed from its website—in no way improve the lives of black Americans. They give up on black America and encourage its needless suffering. Like all Americans, blacks have triumphed over their circumstances only when they have adopted bourgeois virtues such as hard work, respect for learning, self-discipline, faith and personal responsibility. In the 19th century, Frederick Douglass found reading to be the key to his own personal liberation amid slavery, and he understood that whites deliberately withheld literacy from blacks precisely because it was so valuable. Bourgeois values drove blacks to build the powerful religious, fraternal, and other voluntary associations that helped them thrive in the worst days of Jim Crow and cultivated the essential virtues in the next generation. There would have been no civil-rights movement without this. But radical progressives now insist that such virtues are the legacy of white supremacy, colonialist values that reflect the continuing bondage of blacks to oppressive Western culture. The only “authentic” expression of blackness in America, they claim, is the opposite of bourgeois self-restraint and discipline—indulging in the passions of the moment, whether anarchic rioting, insulting teachers or other unsalutary forms of expression. The radical left—disdaining exhortations toward work, family and faith as “respectability politics”—argues that blacks should feel free to indulge their “true” nature, echoing the age-old white-supremacist notion that said nature is violent, lascivious and incapable of self-restraint. The slave masters’ trick of old was to dissuade blacks from adopting bourgeois values precisely so they could be kept in servitude. Marriage was forbidden and families were split apart. Douglass observed that slaves were encouraged to indulge in drink and debauchery during the holidays so they would be “led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery. We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum. So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field—feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.” But there were always those who saw through the trick and used the holidays to hunt, make items for sale, visit distant family members, and hire out their own labor. Some of these were even able—eventually—to purchase their freedom. Tellingly, leftist elites teach their own children the values of working and studying hard even as they encourage behavior among blacks that will make sure they remain uncompetitive but “authentic.” By the time young blacks today discover, as did the slaves of Douglass’s time, that freedom understood as “do whatever you feel like” is no way to build a worthwhile life, it will be too late. The fruits of the civil-rights movement’s hard labor—teaching the young to be so self-disciplined that they were able to resist responding in kind to hatred and abuse from whites—will have been lost. We must turn away from the present course, which preaches despair rather than hope. Black achievement must be glorified. The crucifixion of black America by the radical left must halt. There is a grander, more fruitful future for us all.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.158,0.702,0.139,-0.9922
MLK,WSJ,2020,Robert L. Woodson,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-left-forgets-what-martin-luther-king-stood-for-11579304166,The Left Forgets What Martin Luther King Stood For,"As the nation celebrates the birth of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the progressive left will again seize the moment to twist the story of black Americans’ struggle, to the detriment of those who suffered most in that struggle. They’ll put all the attention on the oppressive conditions faced by black freedom fighters—what white racists did to them—rather than on their own spirit in fighting to gain equal rights under the law. Instead of celebrating blacks’ achievements and the progress made toward delivering on America’s promissory note, the left will transport yesterday’s real injustices into today’s false social-justice narrative, ignoring the principles that were so crucial to Dr. King. History is full of inspiring examples of black people succeeding against the odds, including building their own schools, hotels, railroads and banking systems when doors were closed to them. According to the economist Thomas Sowell, “the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960.” These accomplishments were made possible by a set of values cherished among the blacks of the time: self-determination, resiliency, personal virtue, honesty, honor and accountability. Dr. King understood that these values would be the bedrock for black success once true equality was won. As early as 1953, he warned that “one of the most common tendencies of human nature is that of placing responsibility on some external agency for sins we have committed or mistakes we have made.” Today the progressive left wants to ignore the achievements and pretend that blacks are perpetual victims of white racism. The New York Times’s “1619 Project” essay series is the latest salvo in this attack on America’s history and founding, claiming “anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country.” This statement is an abomination of everything Dr. King stood for. Further, the left’s disinterest in historical accuracy—as evinced in the Times’s dismissal of corrections sought by prominent historians—and its frequent perversion of blacks’ story will have grave consequences not only for blacks but the nation as a whole. In sharp contrast to the claims of the “1619 Project”—which disparages the American Revolution and Declaration of Independence and insists America is hopelessly racist—Dr. King believed deeply in the need to remain true to the Founders’ vision, the “patriot dream that sees beyond the years.” To him, that was the only avenue toward fulfilling America’s promise. As he wrote in his 1963 “Letter From a Birmingham Jail”: “One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. “We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation,” he wrote, “because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America’s destiny.” Dr. King, who sought full participation in America, would never have indulged today’s grievance-based identity politics, whose social-justice warriors use race as a battering ram against the country. In fact, in “Letter From a Birmingham Jail” Dr. King explicitly warned against the type of groupthink that characterizes identity politics: “Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.” Yesterday’s values prepared blacks to walk through the doors of opportunity opened to them through civil rights. Family, faith, character and moral behavior were all crucial to their victories. Today’s social-justice warriors trade on the currency of oppression, deriding the concept of personal responsibility and always blaming external forces. I can think of no better way to instill hopelessness and fear in a young person than to tell him he is a victim, powerless to change his circumstance. During the civil-rights movement blacks never permitted oppression to define who we were. Instead we cultivated moral competence, enterprise and thrift, and viewed oppression as a stumbling block, not an excuse. Dr. King would have refused to participate in today’s identity politics gamesmanship because it frames its grievances in opposition to the American principles of freedom and equality that he sought to redeem. He upheld the country’s founding principles and sought to destroy only what got in the way of delivering the promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the recognition that all men are created equal. Last month the school board of Westfield, N.J., approved a history course on critical race theory, which is the embodiment of the oppressor narrative embraced by the left. At the board meeting a young woman spoke passionately in favor of the course, ending her comments by blaming slavery for the absence of black fathers in the home. This is how successful the left, with its lethal message of despair and distortion of history, has been at undermining agency within the black community. To honor the legacy of Dr. King, we must not only acknowledge the evil he confronted, but also focus on his example in overcoming it. He persevered and triumphed in the face of evil because he was beholden to truth, honor and love for all mankind, driven as he was to see blacks share fully in the American dream. We must not let the purveyors of identity politics fudge the record: Martin Luther King Jr. believed in the promise of America. In fact, he helped to fulfill it.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.12,0.724,0.156,0.9911
MLK,WSJ,2019,Coleman Hughes,https://www.wsj.com/articles/martin-luther-king-colorblind-radical-11547769741,"Martin Luther King, Colorblind Radical","Monday marks Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which means it’s time for the political commentariat to fight its yearly battle for King’s legacy. For critics of identity politics on the left and right, King’s appeals to common humanity over racial division are a rebuke not only to white supremacy but also to the racial ideology of today’s progressives. In this view, King’s dream of a colorblind America—where the content of our character matters more than the color of our skin—is hampered by progressives’ focus on checking white privilege and stoking black grievance. To progressives, such critics have sanitized King’s legacy, erasing its radical elements to avoid acknowledging persistent racial inequality. Progressives highlight his opposition to the Vietnam War, his advocacy for a full-employment policy and a guaranteed minimum income, and his contempt for the materialism spreading through American culture. King’s progressive admirers see “colorblindness” as a pretext for apathy about the plight of black Americans—apathy that King fought vehemently in his day. The refrain that “King was a radical” is less an argument against the colorblind ideal than a way of changing the subject. King was a radical, but by today’s standards only on nonracial issues. Yes, he opposed the Vietnam War, flirted with democratic socialism, and abhorred materialism. But he framed these radical positions as elements of a common human struggle. What policy could be more colorblind than guaranteed income for all Americans? With regard to the role that racial identity should play in politics, King was unequivocal: First and foremost we are human beings, not members of races. The verbal tic of modern racial-justice activists—“As a black man . . .”—would sound foreign on his lips. Even when fighting explicitly racist policies, he deployed universal principles rather than a tribal grievance narrative. “The problem is not a purely racial one, with Negroes set against whites,” King writes of the civil-rights movement in his 1958 essay “Three Ways of Meeting Oppression.” He adds that “nonviolent resistance is not aimed against oppressors but against oppression. Under its banner consciences, not racial groups, are enlisted.” King’s contemporary counterpoints were the Nation of Islam and the black-power movement, which emphasized racial division over common humanity. King didn’t mince words when addressing these movements in a 1960 speech at DePauw University. “Black supremacy is as dangerous as white supremacy, and God is not interested merely in the freedom of black men,” he said. “God is interested in the freedom of the whole human race and in the creation of a society where all men can live together as brothers.” While no one can know what King would have thought about the Black Lives Matter movement, we can take a clue from his speech “Where Do We Go From Here?” given in 1967, a year before his death: “Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout ‘White Power!’—when nobody will shout ‘Black Power!’—but everybody will talk about God’s power and human power.” If conservatives whitewash King’s opinions on economics and foreign policy, then progressives whitewash his views on race. King discussed many topics that now are considered taboo, if not racist, on the left. Consider the problem of violence in the black community. King lamented “frequently and consistently” seeing “brutal acts and crimes by Negroes against Negroes.” “In many a week in Chicago,” he observed in 1966, “as many or more Negro youngsters have been killed in gang fights as were killed in the riots there last summer.” A glance at today’s homicide statistics in Chicago shows that little has changed since King made that observation, yet such violence gets scant attention from racial-justice activists. King also highlighted counterproductive behavioral patterns in the black community—the third rail for today’s racial activists. The current view among progressives is that cultural self-criticism is noble when whites do it but “victim blaming” when blacks do it. In contrast, King held that regardless of racial identity, “one of the sure signs of maturity is the ability to rise to the point of self-criticism,” as expressed in a 1960 address. The final goal King staked for his Southern Christian Leadership Conference was to “reduce the cultural lag” in the black community. And he was clear about the nature of this lag. “Some Negroes have become cynical and disillusioned,” he said in 1960. “So many have used their oppression as an excuse for mediocrity. Many of us live above our means, spend money on nonessentials and frivolities, and fail to give to serious causes, organizations, and educational institutions that so desperately need funds. Our crime rate is far too high.” King didn’t view himself as an advocate for either political party, but as a “conscience of all the parties and all of the people.” His universalist self image—combined with the fact that his politics can’t be summarized easily in a simple left-right paradigm—suggests it’s a mistake to fight over which half of the political spectrum owns his legacy. It belongs to all those who choose to follow his path and take inspiration from his ideals. If we use the adjective “radical” to describe King, then we should follow it with the right nouns. King was a radical Christian, as demonstrated by his commitment to loving his enemies no matter how much they hated him. He was a radical truth-teller, whether that meant telling white moderates that blacks wouldn’t wait any longer to be granted full rights, or telling blacks not to make oppression an excuse for failure. Most important, he was a radical advocate, not on behalf of any subdivision of our species, but on behalf of humanity as a whole.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.163,0.749,0.088,-0.9984
MLK,NYT,2024,Joy-Ann Reid,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/14/opinion/martin-luther-king-medgar-evers.html,Martin Luther King Jr. Wasn’t a Lone Messiah,"Almost 56 years after his death, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stands apart from the other civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He was the most visible, the most frequently heard and seen on television and, in many ways, the most creative in his approach to fighting American apartheid. King loomed so large in his time that he fueled the F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover’s paranoia that a Black messiah would emerge to provoke this nation’s oppressed Black masses to revolution. But King was far from a lone messiah. A young man of tremendous and urgent ambition — King was just 26 years old when he helped organize the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott in 1955 — he built a movement more collaboratively than history gives him credit for. Among those who took inspiration from King was Medgar Evers; they and Malcolm X formed what James Baldwin called the great trio of the civil rights movement. The connection between Evers and King has been lost to history. These two men, close in age but working for different organizations with different approaches to the civil rights movement, intersected in ways that lay bare the challenges the movement faced, particularly in the South, as it balanced the competing interests of Black Americans in cities with those of rural sharecroppers, donors, competing civil rights groups and politicians in Washington. Evers, the then-32-year-old Mississippi field secretary for the N.A.A.C.P., first wrote to King in 1956, hoping to bring him to his home state. A World War II veteran, he had returned from fighting fascism in Europe determined to fight for “first-class citizenship” for Black citizens at home. Evers joined the N.A.A.C.P.’s staff after being refused admission to the University of Mississippi Law School, despite the Supreme Court ruling that it could no longer be segregated. Evers had a more radical vision of Black liberation than did his bosses in New York, who believed the courts would save Black America. Evers viewed King’s Montgomery boycott as a better model for engaging the terrorized sharecroppers of the Delta, who lived under the constant threat of lynching and economic warfare from white people who refused to give up the “Mississippi way of life” nearly a century after slavery ended. Evers spent much of his time organizing sit-ins and walkouts rather than signing people up for N.A.A.C.P. memberships and doing the traditional voter registration favored by the organization’s leadership. King also began his civil rights career, in some ways, in reaction to the N.A.A.C.P. Its lawyers — men and women like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley — were spearheading the fight to force recalcitrant American institutions to recognize the basic humanity of Black citizens, and its leadership didn’t always welcome King’s approach. They were concerned that his confrontational style would get too many young people arrested, siphoning crucial funds from the N.A.A.C.P.’s struggle in the courts, which it viewed as more righteous and effective. Still, Evers could see that King’s methods aligned with his own vision of helping Southern Black folk achieve liberation by standing up for themselves and taking action rather than waiting for racist white people to obey the rulings of the courts. King couldn’t travel to Mississippi in 1956, but a year later, he and Evers met at an N.A.A.C.P. convention and then in New Orleans, where Evers attended the inaugural meetings of King’s new civil rights organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It was the beginning of a correspondence, affinity and mutual admiration that would last until they died. There were risks built into that relationship. When his bosses at N.A.A.C.P. headquarters in New York learned that Evers not only had attended the Southern Christian Leadership Conference organizing meetings but also was elected assistant secretary, the N.A.A.C.P.’s national secretary, Roy Wilkins, issued a stern rebuke. Evers was forced to write him an apologetic letter vowing to withdraw from the new group. King also had many critics in Washington. The Kennedy administration wanted the streets of the segregated South to calm down to remove a powerful propaganda tool being exploited by the Soviets. King’s relentless, though peaceful, activism — rooted in mass marches and economic boycotts that disrupted local and state economies — meant unwanted headaches for the White House. Hoover and the F.B.I. were more worried that King was amassing the power to unite Black, white and Jewish activists — whom he derided as “Communists” — against not just a racist white society but also the government. It was a fear made flesh by the first wave of Freedom Rides in the spring of 1961. Evers had recruited and trained scores of young, Black Mississippi activists via the N.A.A.C.P. Youth Councils. Many joined the white and Black Northern liberal activists who poured into the South on Greyhound and Trailways buses for the Freedom Rides. Some of the Freedom Riders wanted King to travel with them on the buses bound for New Orleans. King declined, citing the fact that he was already on probation for a prior conviction. His decision exposed a generational divide between the young activists in organizations like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Congress of Racial Equality and those like King who were just slightly older — in their 30s — but more tactically cautious out of necessity, with one eye on the streets and the other on Washington. But an incident that May in a Montgomery church helped to reassert King’s moral leadership. As more than 1,000 parishioners and Freedom Riders, along with King, holed up inside the sanctuary of the First Baptist Church, a violent white mob gathered outside, nearly hysterical over the impending Freedom Rides. From the basement, King and the church’s pastor, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, called Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy’s office in Washington and at one point offered to give themselves up to the mob, which was vandalizing cars, assaulting Black passers-by and threatening to burn the building to the ground. The Kennedy administration eventually dispatched U.S. marshals, who absorbed the crowd’s fury and made more than a dozen arrests. Ultimately, the governor of Alabama declared martial law. If the federal government suspected that the various civil rights organizations were working together, they now had the evidence. In 1962 the N.A.A.C.P., the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Congress of Racial Equality formally united, forming a new umbrella organization: the Council of Federated Organizations. Evers signed the compact on behalf of the N.A.A.C.P. Despite the national N.A.A.C.P.’s admonitions, Evers continued to correspond with King and seek to work with him, using King’s Montgomery strategy to build a successful boycott movement in Jackson, Miss. From the winter of 1962 through the spring of 1963, the Jackson movement persuaded Black shoppers to all but abandon downtown shops where they could not be served with dignity, try on clothes, eat in the main dining area or hope to be employed. By May, when Evers delivered a historic televised address rejecting the mayor of Jackson’s lies about happy Black Mississippians under segregation, he had, if briefly, achieved the Kingian movement he hoped for in Mississippi. In doing so, he also became a top target of the White Citizens’ Councils, the state spy organization called the Sovereignty Commission and the Ku Klux Klan. After Evers became the first major civil rights leader to be assassinated in the American South, on June 12, 1963, his widow, Myrlie Evers, stepped into his shoes. She was invited to speak from the main stage at the August 1963 March on Washington. An early draft of King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered to a crowd of 25,000 in Detroit on June 23, 1963, even included a line about Evers and Emmett Till: “I have a dream this afternoon that there will be a day that we will no longer face the atrocities that Emmett Till had to face or Medgar Evers had to face, that all men can live with dignity.” When King himself was murdered in Memphis in April 1968, his wife, Coretta Scott King, entered into a sisterhood of widows, forming a lifelong friendship with the widows of Medgar Evers and Malcolm X. None of those men lived to turn 40. When we celebrate King for his martyrdom and for the uniquely brilliant way he spoke the language of liberation, we should also remember Medgar Evers. King laid the groundwork for many transformative changes — in civil rights, voting rights, the fight against poverty and for a living wage and the subsequent shifts toward immigration expansion, women’s rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. But all of these movements were built by coalitions, not by individuals. The right continues to work to dismantle much of what King’s movement has accomplished. Any victories in the cause of racial progress can be cemented only by coalitions. But those are fragile, too. The fight for civil rights needs no messiah. It needs individuals who are willing to admire and elevate one another’s work and adapt and adopt shared strategies, as King and Evers did. If cohesiveness could exist in their fractured political climate, it can survive in ours.",0.259,0.741,0.0,-0.2732,0.114,0.785,0.101,-0.9404
MLK,NYT,2023,Esau McCaulley,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/15/opinion/martin-luther-king-woke-reparations.html,The Kind of Revolution That Martin Luther King Jr. Envisioned,"In 1968, four days before he was shot on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last Sunday sermon at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. It was entitled, “Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,” and although King doesn’t say the word “woke,” he uses the concept as it was understood by many Black folks then, well before the term was co-opted by the political right to refer to any left-leaning policy that it wanted to condemn. The sermon is an opportunity to encounter the real King, who is too often obfuscated by politicians who use his legacy to support their own agendas. They contend that King was “colorblind,” when in fact his policy aims were unapologetically color-conscious. King opened his sermon by recalling the well-known story of Rip Van Winkle, the character in the Washington Irving tale of the same name who slept for 20 years. King notes that when Rip went to sleep, King George III reigned, and when he awoke, George Washington had become president. Rip Van Winkle had slept through the revolution. King believed that too many Americans, especially those in its churches, were also snoozing through a time ripe for transformation. They needed to wake up to the injustice all around them and make demands for change. What kind of revolution did he envision? King often focused on the financial impacts of white supremacy and the need for America to make amends for its exploitation of Black labor. In the “awake” sermon, King gave a basic and compelling case for reparations based on the “debt” this country owed its Black citizens. He said: There are those who still feel that if the Negro is to rise out of poverty, if the Negro is to rise out of slum conditions, if he is to rise out of discrimination and segregation, he must do it all by himself … But they never stop to realize the debt that they owe a people who were kept in slavery 244 years. In 1863 the Negro was told that he was free as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation being signed by Abraham Lincoln. But he was not given any land to make that freedom meaningful. It was something like keeping a person in prison for a number of years and suddenly, suddenly discovering that that person is not guilty of the crime for which he was convicted. And … you don’t give him any money to get some clothes to put on his back or to get on his feet again in life. For King, waking up is not simply understanding that racism is bad; it is acknowledging that racism created generational wealth for white Americans and robbed Black Americans of the same economic boost. The racial wealth gap King highlighted in his sermon not only persists, but, according to some studies, is basically the same as it was in 1968. In his sermon, King pointed out that at the same time that this country didn’t offer any assistance to Black people, it was giving away millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest to whites. But not only did it give the land, it built land-grant colleges to teach them how to farm. Not only that, it provided county agents to further their expertise in farming; not only that, as the years unfolded it provided low interest rates so that they could mechanize their farms. And to this day thousands of these very persons are receiving millions of dollars in federal subsidies every year not to farm. We tend to focus on King’s impact on the thoughts of individual Americans and think of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a chance for us to disavow racist ideas. One popular quote of King’s is, “I have also decided to stick with love … Hate is too great a burden to bear.” Rejecting hate, then, becomes his entire message, and progress toward King’s dream means more Americans thinking the right things about race. But having positive thoughts, or, at least claiming to do so, doesn’t cost anything. For African Americans, justice has always been more than affirmations of our worth. Justice encompasses economics and makes demands on the pocketbook. It was precisely King’s analysis of the economics of racism that made him controversial while he was alive. King believed that African Americans had a particular case for reparations because of slavery, but he also argued that the United States had a moral obligation as a part of an interconnected society to attend to suffering people beyond its borders. He did not draw a distinction between poor Black descendants of slaves and other oppressed people. In the National Cathedral sermon, he said: We are challenged to rid our nation and the world of poverty. Like a monstrous octopus, poverty spreads its nagging, prehensile tentacles into hamlets and villages all over our world. Two-thirds of the people of the world go to bed hungry tonight … I’ve seen it in Latin America; I’ve seen it in Africa; I’ve seen this poverty in Asia. While the distortions of a resurgent Christian nationalism give theological cover to valuing American lives over others, including when politicians use migrants for political props, we need to remember King’s global vision. It was rooted in his understanding of a Christian faith that focuses its attention outward toward the hurting. One of the more shocking turns in Christian discourse today has been the ability to turn transnational concern into a reason for suspicion rather than a manifestation of God’s wide-ranging affection. Instead of asking what country people hailed from to determine their worth, King asked the biblical question, “Who is my neighbor?” And he answered it using the logic of the good Samaritan: My neighbor is the person in need. In recent years King’s argument has been taken up by others. The historical and practical case for reparations has been laid out by Ta-Nehisi Coates. The state of California has created a task force to address the issue. Just last month, the public theologian Ekemini Uwan made the Christian case for restitution for African and African-descended people at the United Nations office in Geneva, explicitly evoking the Black church’s tradition of economic advocacy. Her claim was that not just countries, but Protestant and Catholic churches, in particular, owe a debt for their role in the slave trade. But the war on “wokeness” will no doubt continue. Its power lies in its ability to erase history and context, to act as if the inequalities that persist sprang into existence haphazardly and require only redoubled efforts of the poor to bring about change. That is the reason for eliminating the discussion of the troubled parts of our history from the classroom. Learning about how our past led to the sufferings of today inevitably raises questions of present responsibility. King’s words remind us that injustice leaves a legacy. It creates inequalities that do not simply disappear. And we need to use that knowledge to chart the long and winding path toward justice.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.117,0.772,0.111,-0.9755
MLK,NYT,2022,Sarah Bahr,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/arts/mlk-day-events-nyc.html,7 Ways to Remember Martin Luther King in New York,"Since 1983, just 15 years after his death, the third Monday in January has been designated as a federal holiday in honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. This year, on Jan. 17, cultural institutions all over New York have planned concerts, exhibitions, service opportunities and tours, both in person and online. (Bring your vaccination card, and check mask-wearing and ticketing policies online beforehand.) Here are seven ways to commemorate the legacy of the civil rights leader and learn more about Black history in New York. An Annual Bash in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Academy of Music’s 36th annual tribute to King, held in person and streaming live at 10:30 a.m. on Monday, will feature a dance piece by Kyle Marshall, set to the oratory of King’s final speech, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” and performances by the singer Nona Hendryx with Craig Harris & Tailgaters Tales and the Sing Harlem choir. A keynote address will also be delivered by Imani Perry, a professor of African American studies at Princeton University. Following the event, visitors can view a display of digital billboards inspired by the writings of bell hooks or attend a free screening at 1 p.m. of the documentary “Attica,” about the violent 1971 prison uprising. Activism and the Arts. The Apollo Theater and WNYC’s 16th annual celebration will hold two virtual broadcasts on Monday, at 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., engaging WNYC radio hosts, scholars and community leaders in a discussion about how the struggle for social justice has affected artists like Nina Simone and John Legend. Guests include the Rev. Al Sharpton, the sports journalist William C. Rhoden and Trazana Beverley, who won a Tony Award for her role in “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf.” The free event can be streamed through the Apollo’s Digital Stage. Discover Seneca Village. Take a tour of Central Park that conjures Seneca Village, the largest community of free African American property owners in early-19th-century New York. Beginning at Mariners’ Gate near the West 85th Street entrance at 2 p.m. on Saturday, your guide will share how the area, once home to around 1,600 residents, provided a respite from the racial discrimination and crowded conditions of downtown Manhattan — until residents were forcibly displaced in 1857 to make way for Central Park. That history is also the subject of a new, vibrant installation across the park, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where “Before Yesterday We Could Fly: An Afrofuturist Period Room” imagines the home of a Village resident as it might still exist if the family had been left to live undisturbed. Make a Craft wavehill.org. Just before leading the marches from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965, King passed through the hamlet of Gee’s Bend and encouraged its 900 residents to vote. They would go on to establish the Freedom Quilting Bee, a group that allowed women of the town to earn an income by making quilts that were sold at Saks and Sears; some textiles have entered the permanent collection of the Met. You can put your own sewing skills to the test on Saturday or Sunday at Wave Hill House in the Bronx, where plentiful squares of fabric will be on hand. Choose a Cause americorps.gov Since King’s birthday was first observed, it’s been a tradition for volunteers across the country to devote the day to service. Whether you commit to a few hours or a whole month, the website of the federal public-service organization AmeriCorps has a directory where you can search for volunteer opportunities (including ones specific to the holiday). There are virtual options, too, like tutoring or transcription for the Smithsonian Institution and National Archives. A Streaming Sermon theaterofwar.com. “The Drum Major Instinct,” a sermon King delivered in 1968 at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, will be presented on Zoom on Monday at 7 p.m. by Theater of War Productions and the office of Jumaane Williams, the New York City public advocate. Along with the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, and the city police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, Williams will take part in a dramatic reading of the text, which challenges people to channel justice, righteousness and peace into acts of service and love. Accompanying them will be performances of music composed in honor of Michael Brown Jr., the 18-year-old Black man who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. ‘Activist New York’ mcny.org. An ongoing exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York chronicles 350 years of social activism in the city, including civil rights, immigration, transgender activism and women’s rights. It begins with the struggle for religious tolerance during the Dutch colonial period, encompasses debates over nudity, prostitution and contraception in New York, from 1870 to 1930, and ends more recently, with the Movement for Black Lives. New material is added regularly, so it’s one to revisit. ",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.877,0.093,0.9941
MLK,NYT,2021,Giovanni Russonello,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/politics/mlk-day-capitol-riot-trump.html?searchResultPosition=11,"This M.L.K. Day, America Has a ‘Long Road Ahead’","On Jan. 5, exactly 10 days before what would have been the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 92nd birthday, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of King’s former church, won election to become Georgia’s first Black senator. As The Associated Press officially called the race in the wee hours of the next morning, pundits on TV hailed the moment as a long-awaited milestone, half a century after Jim Crow had been evicted from the Deep South. But then, just 12 hours later, those channels were flooded with images of Trump supporters smashing their way into the Capitol building. It was hard to miss the stark symbolism of the push-and-pull: President Trump’s high-profile attempt to overturn his loss in Georgia and other states had helped bring these rioters to the Capitol — and Warnock’s victory only seemed to add fuel to their fire. “It’s something people of color are fairly accustomed to in the United States: these moments of progress, moments of advance, that always seem to be tempered by these moments of backlash,” Hakeem Jefferson, a political scientist at Stanford University who studies race and democracy, said in an interview. In a sense, the Capitol riot can be seen as a collision of two main pillars of Trump’s political messaging: disinformation and racial resentment. And in fact, history suggests that they go hand in hand. James Baldwin often pointed out that since white supremacy is a myth, it requires lies to uphold it. “Because they think they are white, they do not dare confront the ravage and the lie of their history,” he wrote in his essay “On Being White and Other Lies.” “Because they think they are white, they cannot allow themselves to be tormented by the suspicion that all men are brothers.” Just over a century ago, during the Red Summer of 1919, a rash of anti-Black riots broke out in cities across the country, driven by a similar cocktail of unsubstantiated and often baldly false claims (frequently about crimes by Black people) and thinly veiled white fears about threats to their own political power in cities. Today, as we officially celebrate King’s birthday, Jefferson views Trump’s alternate-reality politics as embodying the very same commitment that Baldwin talked about: to “whiteness as a kind of fantasy,” he said. “I think what we saw at the Capitol is a culmination of a kind of white grievance politics that the president has stoked for four years, and even before, as an original birther,” Jefferson said. “It’s this imagined world where whiteness is without competition.” Reeling from the attack on the Capitol, Joe Biden and other politicians have insisted that the violence does not represent “who we are” as a nation, pledging to bring the country together under shared ideals and to reject Trump’s divisiveness once and for all. But writing last week in The Undefeated, the critic Soraya Nadia McDonald took issue with the president-elect’s insistence that the country’s true identity had nothing to do with what happened on Jan. 6. “I’ve long found these sorts of proclamations baffling, because if one is honest about the history of the United States, it prominently features white violence, terrorism and revanchism, particularly toward Black people, Indigenous people and women,” McDonald wrote. This calls up King’s own words about America’s commitment to mythmaking. It’s not just extremists and self-proclaimed white supremacists who engage in this practice, the civil rights leader said. “Negroes have proceeded from a premise that equality means what it says, and they have taken white Americans at their word when they talked of it as an objective,” King wrote in his 1967 book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?” White Americans, however, often think of equality as “a loose expression for improvement,” King wrote. When it comes to the gap between Black and white prosperity, white America “seeks only to make it less painful and less obvious but in most respects to retain it.” Certainly, Biden often speaks in concrete terms about his expansive plans to invest in Black wealth generation, overhauling the criminal justice system and combating environmental racism. He and Kamala Harris, the vice president-elect, have in fact been more willing than arguably any other presidential ticket in history to speak explicitly about their plans to address systemic inequality, from an economic and a social perspective. But along the way, they will also have to confront America’s addiction to its oldest myths — and the ways that its newest technologies keep them alive and evolving. In the days since Jan. 6, right-wing broadcasters and social media voices have begun to push a false narrative of what happened at the Capitol, blaming the riot on left-wing groups and Black Lives Matter activists. Of course, no evidence of this has emerged, and the intruders had zealously made clear their intentions to overturn the result of the presidential election. But if these events are a reminder of anything, it’s that the fight for racial justice may be a two-front war, against both inequality and disinformation. Because it’s not only conspiracy theories that are circulating unchecked on social media; it’s also lowest-common-denominator content that caters to voters’ basest fears and prejudices. And it’s likely to continue as long as information is delivered through a basically unregulated marketplace of online platforms. “We have people who believe — I think sincerely — that this was brought on by antifa and Black Lives Matter,” Jefferson said of the Capitol attack. “If we can get a subset of America that believes that incredible lie, it’s a sign of how bad this all is.” “These circumstances are going to make it incredibly challenging for Biden to do what he sincerely says he wants to do, which is to bring the country together,” Jefferson added. “I think we’re in for a long road ahead.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.13,0.776,0.095,-0.9934
MLK,NYT,2020,Charles M. Blow,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/opinion/martin-luther-king.html,The Agitated M.L.K. I Came to Love,"When I was young I idolized the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the way most boys look up to athletes or pop stars. I had a poster of him. I had a T-shirt with his face on it. I recited his “I Have a Dream” speech. It seemed to me that he was a role model, an example of a life for a Southern boy who loved books and learning, leadership and public speaking. There was a dignity about King to which I aspired, a politics of character, a Southern erudition that was rooted in religion, but encompassed an exquisite learnedness. He was a black man who most people had come to venerate, one existing, it seemed, above the trivialities of tense day-to-day racial exchanges, one existing on a higher moral plane. But, as I grew older and learned and read more about King, it became ever more clear to me that the King I had been fed was a caricature of the man he was. I had been taught a reduced King, smooth and polished, a one-dimensional impersonation of a person. I had been taught only the “Dream” King. That is what America wants King to remain: Frozen in perpetual optimism, urging more than demanding, appealing to America’s better angels rather than ruthlessly calling out its persistent demons. But, that must not be done. That must not be done. As King said in a 1967 interview when asked about the “Dream” speech, after much soul-searching he had come to see that “some of the old optimism was a little superficial, and now it must be tempered with a solid realism.” That evolution, toward a more “solid realism,” toward the more rational King, toward the more radical King, is why I happen to believe that one of King’s most consequential speeches is a little-discussed address he gave in 1967 at Stanford University. It was called “The Other America.” He slammed what he called the “white backlash” for being the cause of black discontent and demands for black power, rather than the result of it, calling it “merely a new name for an old phenomenon.” And he declared that true integration “is not merely a romantic or aesthetic something where you merely add color to a still predominantly white power structure.” This speech was delivered after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As King put it in the 1967 interview, passage of those acts came at “bargained rates.” He explained: “It didn’t cost the nation anything. In fact, it helped the economic side of the nation to integrate lunch counters and public accommodations. It didn’t cost the nation anything to get the right to vote established. And, now we are confronting issues that cannot be solved without costing the nation.” It seems that King was even open to the idea of reparations, if not explicitly by name, at least in spirit. King said in his Stanford speech: “In 1863 the Negro was freed from the bondage of physical slavery. But at the same time, the nation refused to give him land to make that freedom meaningful. And at that same period America was giving millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest, which meant that America was willing to undergird its white peasants from Europe with an economic floor that would make it possible to grow and develop, and refused to give that economic floor to its black peasants.” He extended this thought in other speeches, pointing out that not only did the government give the land to these white people, it also used government money to start land-grant colleges to teach them how to farm, sent out county agents to further their expertise, offered low-interest loans so that they could mechanize and instituted a system of subsidies for them, and these became “the very people telling the black man he ought to lift himself by his own boot straps.” As King put it about his Poor People’s Campaign, “Now, when we come to Washington in this campaign we’re coming to get our check.” King was assassinated a month before the campaign was supposed to head to Washington. And King was not afraid to point out white people’s hypocrisy, particularly that of the white moderates, those who were opposed to anti-black cruelty but did not genuinely endorse black equality, fully and unequivocally. King wrote in his “Letter From a Birmingham Jail”: “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice.” As a child, I idolized the narrowed King. As an adult I love the more complicated King: agitated, exhausted and even angry.",0.268,0.357,0.375,0.296,0.069,0.853,0.078,0.8527
MLK,NYT,2019,Concepción de León,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/books/martin-luther-king-jr.html,Remembering Martin Luther King Jr.,"As is often the case with those who die young, Martin Luther King Jr. has become more symbol than man: pacifist, beacon of nonviolent racial reform. But over the last 50 years since his assassination, that view has been complicated. His “I Have a Dream” speech, taught in schools and exalted for its vision of a racial utopia, has been re-examined, showing how King’s views evolved in his final years, recognizing how much work remained to be done to achieve true equality. These books paint a complete picture of King, including biographies, novels and King’s final written work. PARTING THE WATERS America in the King Years 1954-63 By Taylor Branch 1,064 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. (1988) In the words of our reviewer, this Pulitzer Prize-winning work (the first of Branch’s three-volume social history) tells “the story behind the uprooting of America’s tragic racial traditions without which a definitive interpretation of post-World War II America cannot be made.” King is at the center of the book, but its scope is more broad, and Branch’s “fundamental insight is that King shared the movement with an extraordinary array of catalytic personalities,” including Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin and numerous student activists, whom our reviewer said helped marry King’s “intellectual grasp of theology to the direct action that made the movement successful.” BEARING THE CROSS Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference By David J. Garrow 800 pages. William Morrow. (1986) Relying on interviews with King’s closest associates, F.B.I. documents (including wiretapped conversations) and King’s personal papers, this biography, which also won a Pulitzer, explores “the sacred and profane” aspects of King’s life, documenting his civil rights achievements along with “the inner torments King suffered because of his compulsive sexual adventuring and because of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s conscienceless campaign to use this weakness to destroy him,” according to our reviewer. Garrow shows how King’s intellect and analytical side powered his work, while his faith sustained him. MARCH TRILOGY By John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell 560 pp. Top Shelf Productions. (2016) This graphic memoir series, the third of which won a National Book Award for young people’s literature, chronicles Lewis’s coming-of-age in the civil rights movement as a student activist working with King and others. Our reviewer called it “a capsule lesson in courage of conscience, a story that inspires without moralizing or simplifying in hindsight.” It opens with the march in Selma, Ala., that Lewis led in March 1965 — a turning point for the civil rights movement that is known as “Bloody Sunday” for the violent beatings state troopers and local police officers inflicted on nonviolent protesters, including Lewis, who was 25 at the time. Our reviewer said the book is “designed to help new generations of readers visualize the possibilities of political engagement” and “is the story of an education, an introduction to the difficult art of principled dissent — or, as Lewis has called it, ‘necessary trouble.’” WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE: CHAOS OR COMMUNITY? By Martin Luther King Jr. 256 pp. Beacon Press. (1967) In his final book, written in 1967 after a decade of civil rights work, King lays out his vision for America’s future, including the need for better jobs and housing, higher pay and quality education. He also writes about how reforms had fallen short: “Laws are passed in a crisis mood after a Birmingham or a Selma, but no substantial fervor survives the formal signing of legislation. The recording of the law in itself is treated as the reality of the reform.” DREAMER By Charles Johnson 236 pp. Scribner. (1998) In this imagined account of King’s final days, Johnson gives him a doppelgänger named Chaym Smith who, when the pair meet in Chicago, gets a job as King’s stand-in. Smith served in the military during the Korean War and, since his return, has suffered alcoholism and had a mental breakdown; he lost his wife and kids. As Smith learns to impersonate King, Johnson uses the parallel to explore how society determines what makes one man great and another not. “Johnson has created King’s body double and spiritual doppelgänger not so he can unfold a thriller but in order to explore the soul of inequality and some of the unpleasant ways in which the world divides,” wrote our reviewer. “As a journey, ‘Dreamer’ is not content merely to explore inequality and its pesky moral dilemmas; it goes farther, to hold up a mirror in which the interrelatedness of these apparent opposites can be viewed.” DEAR MARTIN By Nic Stone 210 pp. Crown Books for Young Readers. (2016) (Ages 14 and up) This young adult novel follows Justyce McAllister, an ambitious black student at an elite private school in Atlanta who is the captain of the debate team and has stellar grades. But a number of racially motivated incidents force Justyce to realize some will always judge him by his skin color. In his diary, which is addressed to King, he writes, “I grew up in a rough area, but I know I’m a good dude, Martin. I thought if I made sure to be an upstanding member of society, I’d be exempt from the stuff THOSE black guys deal with, you know? Really hard to swallow that I was wrong.” I MAY NOT GET THERE WITH YOU The True Martin Luther King Jr. By Michael Eric Dyson 404 pp. The Free Press. (2000) In this more recent biography of King, Dyson argues that we have “sanitized his ideas” and “twisted his identity so he appears more saintly,” wrote our reviewer. King lost many white supporters when, in the last few years of his life, his eyes were opened to America’s commitment to racism, and his rhetoric became less hopeful. In 1968, he declared, “I am sorry to have to say that the vast majority of white Americans are racists, either consciously or unconsciously,” while advocating for wide-ranging affirmative action programs and black nationalist and socialist ideas. According to our reviewer, Dyson is at his best when he “provides close readings of the less well-known sermons.” Dyson suggests a moratorium on reading King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, writing, “If we are forced to live without that speech for a decade, we may be forced to live it instead. In so doing, we can truly preserve King’s hope for racial revolution.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.092,0.804,0.104,0.916

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., though most associated with the South, had deep ties to New York City, dating back to the fall of 1950, when he served as a student pastor every other month at the First Baptist Church in East Elmhurst, Queens. The senior pastor there gave him a B for “pulpit ability,” knocking him for “aloofness.” That would change. The city almost saw the end of his career as well: at a 1958 book signing in Harlem, a woman named Izola Ware Curry stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, convinced that Dr. King and others in the movement were plotting against her (she was committed to a hospital for the criminally insane). Dr. King remembered the incident in his “I Have Been to the Mountaintop” speech a day before his death, noting that if he had sneezed while the blade was in him, he would not have survived to see the gains of the movement he led. “I’m so happy that I didn’t sneeze,” he said. New York offered Dr. King the friendly pulpit of Riverside Church, and access to leaders of the anti-war movement, which became a major focus for him. The city also connected him to black entertainers like Harry Belafonte, and liberal donors who provided bail money and legal support. Dr. King wrote a column for The Amsterdam News, served as honorary chairman of the Gandhi Society for Human Rights, on East 40th Street in Manhattan, and in 1967 led a massive march from Central Park to the United Nations, where he decried what he called a racist war in Vietnam. The images shown here date from 1957 to February 1968, when he spoke at a centennial tribute to W.E.B. DuBois. By then he was an official honorary New Yorker, with a Medallion of Honor presented to him by Mayor Robert F. Wagner. If the city was never his home, in these pictures it did its best to match the tension and monumental focus that marked his too-short life.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.054,0.834,0.112,0.9534
MLK,NYT,2017,Jason Sokol,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/opinion/which-martin-luther-king-are-we-celebrating-today.html,Which Martin Luther King Are We Celebrating Today?,"Newburyport, Mass. — Every year on the third Monday of January, Americans of all races, backgrounds and ideologies celebrate the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He is rightly lionized and sanctified by whites as well as blacks, by Republicans as well as Democrats. It is easy to forget that, until fairly recently, many white Americans loathed Dr. King. They perceived him as a rabble rouser and an agitator; some rejoiced in his assassination in April 1968. How they got from loathing to loving is less a story about growing tolerance and diminishing racism, and more about the ways that Dr. King’s legacy has been scrubbed and blunted. The Dr. King we remember today is particularly at odds with his radical turn in his last years. In 1967 he denounced the Vietnam War and warned that America was courting “spiritual death.” In early 1968 he planned the Poor People’s Campaign, in which millions of impoverished Americans — black, white and Latino — would gather in Washington for an enormous demonstration. He called for $30 billion annually in antipoverty spending, and asked Congress to guarantee an income for each American. To many Americans, this sounded like socialist lunacy. Dr. King spent his final days in Memphis, marching with striking sanitation workers. On March 28, 1968, some marchers behind him turned violent. His critics believed their argument had been proved — that Dr. King’s claims to nonviolence were so much pretense. When he was killed a week later, Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, told an audience that Dr. King was “an outside agitator, bent on stirring people up.” Ronald Reagan, then governor of California, described Dr. King’s killing as a “great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order, and people started choosing which laws they’d break.” But Dr. King’s legacy — the meaning of “Martin Luther King” in the popular mind — began to change as soon as the man himself left us. As groups like the Black Panthers and the Weathermen called for armed resistance, Dr. King’s peaceful methods looked more appealing. Many white Americans focused on one line of King’s “I Have a Dream” speech — that he longed for the day when his children would “not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character” — and molded him into a gentle champion of colorblindness. The King holiday was both cause and effect of this selective appropriation. Congressman John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan, first proposed a holiday bill in 1968, and he offered the legislation virtually every year thereafter. In 1983, it finally neared passage. Though Reagan, by then president, opposed the holiday, congressional Republicans realized that endorsing the bill could help to burnish their party’s civil rights bona fides. The House passed the legislation by a wide margin. But the debate in the Senate did Republicans no favors. Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, filibustered the bill, saying that Dr. King “appears to have welcomed collaboration with Communists” and distributed a 300-page packet detailing Dr. King’s supposed treachery. Mr. Helms eventually ended his filibuster, and on Oct. 19 the Senate passed the holiday bill. Dr. King’s opponents weren’t done. The Conservative Caucus collected 43,000 signatures on a petition urging Reagan to veto the holiday. But Reagan signed the bill anyway — in large part because, Senator Helms aside, many conservatives had “discovered,” and embraced, a useful version of Dr. King. That embrace tightened during the battle over affirmative action. On Jan. 15, 1986, days before the first Martin Luther King Day, Attorney General Edwin Meese proposed to eliminate minority hiring goals for federal contractors. Using words that would be repeated, in one form or another, throughout the affirmative-action debate, Mr. Meese claimed that his proposal was “very consistent with what Dr. King had in mind.” In 1996, Louisiana’s governor signed an executive order to halt affirmative action programs. “King sort of believed like I do,” said Mike Foster, a Republican. “I can’t find anywhere in his writings that he wanted reverse discrimination.” (Mr. Foster’s search apparently did not include Dr. King’s book “Where Do We Go From Here?” in which he explained: “A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him.”) This reappropriation continues today. In an attack on Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, for kneeling in protest during the national anthem, the Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney said that people like Mr. Kaepernick should “move to another country.” Mr. Swinney recommended that protesters heed Dr. King’s shining example: “I think the answer to our problems is exactly what they were for Martin Luther King when he changed the world. Love, peace, education, tolerance of others, Jesus” — as if Dr. King never criticized his country or paralyzed American cities with campaigns of civil disobedience. In this season of political polarization, it is tempting to hope that we can unite in celebration of Dr. King. But celebrators ought to know whom they are honoring. Dr. King died for striking garbage workers and beseeched his government to protect the vulnerable. He had a message for those who would target immigrants or wall off America from the world. In a 1967 speech, he declared: “Our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than national.” Instead of policing their borders, nations should “develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole.” The alternative was unacceptable. “History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate.” To honor Dr. King is to follow a different path.",0.0,0.654,0.346,0.5719,0.062,0.81,0.128,0.9972

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A new edition of What’s Going On in This Picture? will be available early next Monday. Although we have many, many resources in our ever-growing M.L.K. Day collection, this year we want to highlight one in particular, an essay that appeared in The New York Times Magazine in September. In “Teaching Martin Luther King Jr. in the Age of Freddie Gray,” Syreeta McFadden writes about discussing “Letter From Birmingham Jail” with her students at a community college in Manhattan: ""… We returned to King’s letter, in which he draws a distinction between just and unjust laws. They didn’t know about this King, I found, the one who fought the law. In their view, the civil rights movement was embodied in King the Christlike leader, who stands for peace, love and brotherhood. I told the students that King went to jail a lot for peace, love and brotherhood. We talked about Baltimore, where the police had just killed Freddie Gray and street protests were swelling to an uprising. My students were skeptical of headlines and commentary that called for nonviolent protest. One of the students noted that the police were violent, too, and they were placing people in mortal danger just to protect some buildings from being damaged. “A building is not more valuable than a person,” she said. Most of the others nodded in agreement. More began to speak. The rote discussion was becoming impassioned, cacophonous: “But there’s a difference between rioting and peaceful protest. …” “Are we saying property is more valuable than a human being?” “That’s like saying to protest is unlawful. …” “What does ‘peaceful’ even mean?”"" Read about the rest of the discussion that day, and think about the implications for your own classroom. How does teaching about Dr. King and the civil rights movement look different in the era of Ferguson, Mo., Freddie Gray and the Black Lives Matter movement? Do you have to be disobedient if you want justice? How would your students answer?

July4th,WSJ,2016,,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-better-gop-agenda-1467672372,The Better GOP Agenda,"Donald Trump is running for President by stressing opposition to trade and immigration. That limited—we’d say crabbed—agenda means that if the presumptive GOP nominee does by some chance win in November, the proposals to watch are coming out of the Republican House majority. Mr. Trump will need their ideas to have any hope of governing. The good news is that this other GOP agenda is the most pro-growth in years. Speaker Paul Ryan’s House colleagues have rolled out proposals to reform health care and welfare, make the financial system more resilient, and revive Congressional authority against the administrative state. The overriding goal is to gain an electoral mandate to implement an agenda in 2017 to increase economic growth and lift wages from their Obama-era trough. These ideas deserve more attention than they’ve received, especially the detailed tax reform floated in late June by the Ways and Means Committee. Chairman Kevin Brady’s proposal refines former Chairman Dave Camp’s 2014 draft into what would be the most far-reaching tax reform since the Reagan-Rostenkowski condominium of 1986. We can break the news that analysts at the Tax Foundation have inspected the details and will report this week that the House reform would raise American GDP by 9.1% in the long run, lift wages by 7.7% and add some 1.7 million jobs. These are estimates and depend on all other things being equal. But the Tax Foundation’s model is well regarded and reflects what economists believe is possible by reducing tax barriers on work and investment. The Tax Foundation scores the revenue impact of tax bills on a static and dynamic basis, the latter including the effect on economic growth. Its analysts estimated that Mr. Trump’s tax reform would lose $10 trillion in revenue over 10 years even on a dynamic basis—in part because it didn’t specify reductions in tax loopholes. So it’s notable that the foundation scores the House reform as reducing federal revenue by only $2.4 trillion over 10 years and a mere $191 billion after accounting for faster economic growth. The larger economy and higher wages would result mainly from the reform’s far lower after-tax cost of capital investment. Specifically, Mr. Brady wants to cut the top corporate-tax rate to 20% from 35% to make the U.S. more competitive and stop driving American companies overseas. He’d move to a territorial system that taxes future corporate income where in the world it is earned. Mr. Brady also improves the tax code for subchapter S and small businesses that currently pay at the personal-tax rate that can reach more than 44%. These businesses would pay a rate no higher than 25%, and they’d also benefit from immediate 100% expensing of new investment. Corporations and small businesses would see their tax burden cut by about 43%—providing a huge economic lift to business investment that has lagged during this not-so-great expansion. The House proposal on individual taxes is more disappointing, albeit still better than the status quo. Mr. Brady would collapse the seven current tax brackets to three, with a top rate of 33%. This top rate is well above the 28% of the 1986 reform and reflects the current political neuralgia about cutting marginal tax rates lest they benefit the affluent. Cutting marginal rates provides a big economic benefit by reducing taxes on labor, notably spouses in two-earner households. (See editorial nearby.) The top rate will end up higher as the price for Senate Democratic votes. The House would tax dividends, capital gains and investment income at the personal-tax rate, albeit with a 50% exclusion that effectively cuts the rate in half. Mr. Brady also flinches by keeping the charitable and mortgage-interest deductions. This is another bow to politics and the housing lobby, which may be the most subsidized industry in the country other than green energy. The better news is that Ways and Means would eliminate so many other credits and loopholes that its white paper explaining the proposal says most taxpayers could fill out their annual returns on a 14-line postcard. This simplicity adds to the political appeal of reform. The House proposal has no chance of getting past a Senate filibuster or presidential veto this year, but it does show how Republicans in Congress are poised to capitalize on a November victory. We hear Mr. Trump is considering a rewrite of the bare-bones proposal he offered in the primaries, but he could do worse than adopt the House plan. The House reform shows what would be possible with a serious GOP President.",0.0,0.508,0.492,0.4404,0.067,0.812,0.121,0.9902
July4th,WSJ,2016,Gerald F Seib,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-strategic-thinking-behind-trump-clinton-vp-picks-1467647189,"The Strategic Thinking Behind Trump, Clinton VP Picks","The Fourth of July weekend marked not just a national holiday but the arrival of a quadrennial spectacle: Guess the vice presidential pick. This year, of course, we get the game times two. Because there is no incumbent president running for re-election, the two presumptive nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, must choose. And the rest of us get to guess. Sadly, it’s a losing proposition. Names are advanced and contenders called in, but it’s hard to know which are serious and which the campaigns float merely so some contender and his or her supporters will be flattered by an appearance on the shortlist. Sometimes it turns out the real choices weren’t on the much-discussed shortlists at all; did anybody really see Sarah Palin and Dan Quayle coming? It is possible and enlightening, though, to think about what Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump might try to accomplish with their picks. So here are five possible goals they could try to achieve with the vice presidential selections they make in the next few weeks, along with some of the contenders who might help them reach those goals: -- Play to the base. One thing a vice presidential pick can do is energize a part of the party’s base that isn’t entirely sold on the nominee. For Mrs. Clinton, that would mean finding somebody who can excite the loyal, liberal followers of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who aren’t in love with her. The obvious choice here is Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, though Labor Secretary Tom Perez also is a possibility. For Mr. Trump, his party’s conservative movement is highly suspicious of him. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would help there; he is trusted by both social and ideological conservatives and has the added bonus of long experience as a member of Congress, meeting another Trump desire to name someone who can navigate Washington. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich also carries the twofer mix of trusted conservative with Washington pedigree. -- Win a key state. Nominees can make a strategic choice of a running mate in hopes of using the pick to lock up a swing state that could go either way. For Mr. Trump, that might suggest North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. North Carolina went Democratic, barely, in 2008, then swung back to the Republicans in 2012. Mr. Trump needs badly to keep it there. Mr. Burr also is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which would help shore up Mr. Trump’s credentials on national security. Another possibility in this category would be Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a state Mr. Trump has said he’d love to win back from the Democrats. That seems like a long shot, though, and Mr. Christie’s popularity is sagging at home. For Mrs. Clinton, there are few states more important than Ohio, and there a reliable liberal ally, Sen. Sherrod Brown, could be an attractive strategic pick. -- Hit a key demographic. Mr. Trump needs help with women. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, whom Mr. Trump was to meet Monday, could provide that; she also happens to represent a swing state. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin could also punch this ticket. Mrs. Clinton would like to lock up a big Hispanic vote, which means Housing Secretary Julián Castro or his twin brother, Rep. Joaquín Castro, rising stars in her party, could be appealing. Ditto for Rep. Xavier Becerra, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. A choice of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, meanwhile, would send a powerful signal to African-American Democrats that their standing in the party won’t diminish in the post-Barack Obama era. -- Shake things up. Mr. Trump probably doesn’t need any help in this category. He has shaken things up plenty all by himself. Mrs. Clinton, though, might want to show that she is thinking outside the political establishment box in which many put her, and appeal directly to moderates and business leaders put off by Mr. Trump’s style and populist positions. That’s why some are speculating that Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, might be under consideration. -- Play it safe. One approach is to eschew all these tactical goals and simply pick someone the nominee is comfortable with—and whose credentials as a potential president are solid, whether they excite the electorate in some other way or not. For Mr. Trump, that might suggest Sen. Jeff Sessions. He’s a 10-year Senate veteran, a former U.S. attorney, a reliable conservative—and, perhaps as important, an early Trump supporter. His home state of Alabama is reliably red, so Mr. Trump doesn’t need his help there. But he checks the knows-Washington box. For Mrs. Clinton, the similarly comfortable choice might be Tim Kaine or his fellow Virginia senator, Mark Warner. They may be too moderate to please some in the party’s liberal wing—and Mr. Kaine has a complicated record on abortion rights—but they would be reassuring to independent voters, and also represent a key swing state.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.028,0.79,0.182,0.9994
July4th,WSJ,2016,Peter Nicholas,http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clintons-negatives-complicate-ties-down-the-ballot-1467665079,Hillary Clinton’s Negatives Complicate Ties Down the Ballot,"Hillary Clinton will campaign alongside Barack Obama in North Carolina on Tuesday in their first joint appearance of the election season, expecting a boost from a sitting president whose popularity is strong among the sorts of voters Democrats need to turn out in the battleground state. Less clear is whether Mrs. Clinton can offer the same sort of lift for fellow Democrats in tough races of their own. An offshoot of Mrs. Clinton’s low favorability rating is that candidates who tie themselves to her risk alienating voters they need to win, polling shows. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey last month asked whether people would be more inclined to vote for a Democratic candidate who endorsed Mrs. Clinton’s presidential bid. Some 32% said they would be less likely to vote for that candidate, while only 15% said they would be more inclined. More than half said the endorsement wouldn’t matter either way. In a dozen battleground states—including North Carolina—voters by a 13-point margin would be less inclined to vote for candidates who endorse Mrs. Clinton, the Journal/NBC poll showed. Among independent voters, just 4% said they would be more apt to vote for candidates who support Mrs. Clinton, while 38% would be less inclined. So it’s not an easy call to share a stage with the presumptive Democratic nominee in states that are up for grabs in November, analysts say. When Mrs. Clinton made a campaign stop in Raleigh, N.C., on June 22, neither Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Cooper nor Senate hopeful Deborah Ross showed up for the rally. Both cited scheduling conflicts. Both Ms. Ross and Mr. Cooper are planning to attend the event in Charlotte with Mrs. Clinton and the president, who is especially popular among African-American voters. Blacks constituted about one-third of the electorate in the North Carolina Democratic primary in March. “We have a sizable African-American population, and it’s important for any Democrat running statewide that they turn out. There’s no one more capable of doing that than the president,” said Andrew Taylor, a political-science professor at North Carolina State University. A Clinton campaign spokesman, Jesse Ferguson, said that while “every candidate has to run their own campaign,” the presumptive nominee “is proud to partner with Democrats in North Carolina.” Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, is an even riskier candidate for state and local GOP candidates to endorse, polling shows. Some 40% of voters said they would be less inclined to vote for a Republican candidate who endorsed Mr. Trump, the Journal poll showed, while only 16% said they would be more likely to back the candidate. An additional 43% said the endorsement would have no impact. Such numbers are rooted in the unusually poor public images of both party’s presumptive nominees, polling experts said. Going back to 1992, no major party nominee has racked up negative ratings as high as the two 2016 candidates. As of last month, 55% had an unfavorable view of Mrs. Clinton; 60%, Mr. Trump. “Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have a similar negative impact for other candidates on the ballot,” said Micah Roberts, a Republican who helped conduct the Journal/NBC survey along with Democratic pollster Fred Yang. “It’s very important, and it’s something both sides of the aisle are struggling with.” Improving Mrs. Clinton’s image has been a continuing project since she first arrived on the national stage in 1992. Assessing her public image, she said last week in Chicago that she isn’t happy to hear that people don’t trust her. “I personally know I have work to do on this front,” she said. She blamed political opponents and “conspiracy theorists” for distorting her image but conceded she understands “trust has to be earned.” Peter Hart, a longtime Democratic polling expert, said this month’s Philadelphia convention is a marquee forum for her campaign to show a side of Mrs. Clinton that people find more appealing. That, in turn, could make it more advantageous for Democratic candidates to bind themselves to her candidacy. “The campaign just has to shift gears in terms of how she’s being portrayed and how she’s seen,” Mr. Hart said. He talked about how a professional actor’s image can be improved with proper lighting and different makeup. “There’s nothing wrong with her. It’s just the Hillary Clinton we’re seeing is not a very attractive Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Hart added.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.88,0.07,0.9206

Opposition,"WASHINGTON—President Trump used a July 4 celebration at the White House to rail against what he called the “radical left” amid nationwide demonstrations and to declare the U.S. is making progress against the coronavirus even as cases rise in parts of the country. From the south lawn of the White House, Mr. Trump renewed his comments from a day earlier at Mount Rushmore, criticizing people who, amid protests over police brutality and systemic racism, have sought to tear down or vandalize statues of and monuments to figures who owned slaves or held racist views. “We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who in many instances have absolutely no idea what they are doing,” he said, pledging to never give in to an “angry mob.” While the president stressed the importance of preserving history, he also nodded at the idea that progress is ongoing. “Our past is not a burden to be cast away. It is not a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. This incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation picking up where the last finished,” he said. With fireworks and military flyovers, Mr. Trump was looking for a patriotic show of force in Washington. The festivities came amid the continuing protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody—which were under way in the district Saturday—as well as the pandemic that continues to grip the nation. The president argued that the U.S. is making progress against the coronavirus, saying that he expected a “therapeutic or vaccine solution long before the end of the year,” an ambitious timeline. He made the comment on a day when the nation recorded 50,000 new cases, as leaders around the country encouraged people not to attend July 4 gatherings. Invited guests, including law enforcement, medical professionals and military, as well as administration members, who gathered on the South Lawn of the White House for Mr. Trump’s remarks were not all wearing masks. Most people who attended a Mount Rushmore fireworks show attended by Trump Friday were also not in masks. Organizers were providing 300,000 masks to people who went to the National Mall to watch the fireworks, and they strongly encouraged social distancing, but no action will be taken against those who don’t comply. A news release from the Department of Interior promised more than 10,000 fireworks launched from a roughly mile-long area. Saturday’s event was scaled down in some ways from last year. In 2019, the celebration included flyovers of jet fighters, military bands, tanks and armored vehicles, as well as remarks from the president from the Lincoln Memorial. That event sought to fulfill a goal of Mr. Trump’s to showcase the nation’s military with a gusto similar to that of the 2017 Bastille Day parade he watched in Paris. Mr. Trump praised the armed services during his remarks Saturday, referencing the U.S. airstrike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and the raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State leader. The president’s relationships with the nation’s armed forces have been strained recently over his handling of protests following the killing of Mr. Floyd in police custody and military leaders’ suggestions that bases honoring Confederate officers should be renamed. The president also praised the police, as he has throughout the demonstrations. He said attendees at the White House festivities included the family of David Dorn, a retired police captain who was shot and killed during a looting incident last month. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has been telling residents to stay close to home and be cautious about hosting or attending gatherings. While the spread of the virus has slowed in the Washington area, she has stressed that new cases continue to be diagnosed and has urged vigilance. Through July 2, Washington has had 10,454 positive coronavirus cases and 555 deaths. The district is in phase two of its reopening, meaning gyms and nail salons can be open with restrictions, and restaurants may offer limited indoor dining. Most gatherings of more than 50 people are barred, but that doesn’t apply to federal sites. During a news conference, Ms. Bowser warned against going to the Mall for the event. She said she had reviewed an announcement from the Department of Interior about the plans, and “we’ve communicated to them that we do not think that this is in keeping with the best” guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Health. But, she added, “this event will take place entirely on federal property.” On Friday, Ms. Bowser tweeted, “Just because someone invites you to a party doesn’t mean you have to go.” The monuments in downtown D.C. were also designated as gathering spots for a series of protests that organizers said would peacefully draw attention to violence against the Black community and other causes. Video on social media and MSNBC showed crowds marching during the day Saturday. The protests marked the sixth week of civil rights-centered gatherings following Mr. Floyd’s killing in late May. At Mount Rushmore on Friday, the president also said he was signing an executive order that aims to create a “National Garden of American Heroes,” a park featuring statues of significant Americans. The order creates a task force to pursue the goal, aiming to open it before July 4, 2026. The statues could include those that were removed or destroyed in other locations.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.089,0.834,0.076,-0.958
July4th,WSJ,2020,Jess Bravin,https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rejects-bid-by-illinois-gop-to-avoid-limits-on-gatherings-11593906161,Supreme Court Rejects Bid by Illinois GOP to Avoid Limits on Gatherings,"WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Saturday rejected a bid by Illinois Republicans to lift Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s public-health order limiting gatherings to 50 or fewer people, disrupting plans for an Independence Day picnic south of Chicago. The group filed suit last month, asking for an exemption from the 50-person limit that the Democratic governor had previously granted for religious services. They also claimed the state of Illinois hadn’t enforced attendance caps during Black Lives Matter protests following the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who oversees federal courts in the Seventh Circuit covering Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, denied the emergency application without comment several hours after it was filed on Saturday. “We advise our clients to follow the governor’s order, which in this case means no gatherings over 50 until we get this outcome changed on appeal,” said Daniel Suhr, an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center in Chicago who represents the Republican Party. Kristen Williamson, spokeswoman for the Liberty Justice Center, said the picnic had been canceled. The governor’s office couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. In May, Justice Kavanaugh was among four conservative dissenters when the court declined to set aside California health orders capping attendance at church services to 100 people. The Illinois Republicans argued that under the First Amendment, their political organizing activities were entitled to treatment as favorable as that accorded to religious worship. “The months leading up to a presidential election are the busiest and most important for the Party,” they told the Supreme Court. “During this time, it organizes its staff, volunteers, voters, and donors to maximum effect. It undertakes numerous meetings and public events, including rallies, bus tours, training sessions, phone banks, fundraising receptions, press conferences, headquarters ribbon-cuttings and meet-and-greet coffees. In-person interaction is vital to ensuring the full effectiveness of these events.” The Republican Party Independence Day picnic was planned for Will County, south of Chicago. Postponing the event until after the emergency would cause Republicans an “irreparable injury,” they argued. “A picnic, even with fireworks, on some other day is no substitute for the special patriotic environment created on the Fourth of July,” their brief said. Last Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis in Chicago denied the Republican request to block Gov. Pritzker’s order while the lawsuit proceeds, finding their odds of ultimately prevailing to be “less than negligible.” She said the Republican Party provided no evidence that the state had selectively enforced its public health orders and that Gov. Pritzker’s participation in a Black Lives Matter demonstration “is not enough to establish such discrimination.” The group appealed to the Seventh Circuit, but on Friday the appeals court upheld Judge Ellis. “If 100 Democrats or 100 Republicans gather and 10 get infected, those 10 may go home and infect a local shopkeeper, a local grocery-store worker, their postal carrier, or their grandmother—someone who had no interest in the earlier gathering. Thus, the balance of harms in this instance strongly favors the governor,” said the panel, which included Chief Judge Diane Wood and Judges Joel Flaum and Amy Coney Barrett. “The need to fight Covid-19 effectively…necessarily takes into account both the extraordinarily infectious nature of this particular virus and the very high efficiency of transmission,” the unsigned opinion said. “There is thus a very close link between a measure regulating the size of gatherings and the goal of impeding the spread of the virus.” Separately, a state judge in southern Illinois last week ruled that Gov. Pritzker’s health orders were invalid. The state was expected to appeal.",0.3,0.5,0.2,-0.2023,0.066,0.847,0.087,0.7823

With infections and hospitalizations rising across swaths of the U.S., the holiday—which typically draws big crowds to beaches, daylong barbecues, concerts, parades and evening fireworks displays—has sparked worry for many public officials. More states have mandated mask-wearing in recent days, and quarantines have been put in place in some states and cities. President Trump was set to host a large celebration in the nation’s capital, with fireworks on the National Mall, even as the city’s mayor urged people to stay home because of coronavirus concerns. Organizers are providing 300,000 masks and strongly encouraging usage and social distancing but won’t take action against those who don’t comply. For many Americans, the pandemic has upended the traditional holiday celebrations, as fireworks displays have gone virtual or been canceled. Robert B. Whitehill, a 57-year-old resident of Montclair, N.J., said he and his family often attend fireworks displays or community parades on the Fourth of July. This year, they are opting for a quiet, socially-distanced gathering outdoors with a few neighbors. “We’re all about limiting exposure to crowds,” said Mr. Whitehill. The nation on Friday added 52,104 new coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, bringing total confirmed infections to more than 2.8 million cases. Florida, Texas, California and Arizona were among the hardest-hit states, while a number of other states set records for new daily cases. The U.S. has the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities globally, with more than 129,500, according to data from Johns Hopkins. The U.S. currently has 39.56 deaths per 100,000 residents, which places it among the top 10 countries in the world in that metric. However, the U.S. doesn’t have the highest percentage of fatal cases—currently at about 4.4%, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. And the case-fatality count in the U.S. has dropped a bit, from about 5.1%, over the last two weeks. Infectious-disease epidemiologists caution that deaths typically lag behind other indicators, as the disease often progresses over the course of weeks in the most severe cases. The Florida health department on Saturday reported more than 11,400 new cases, setting a new daily record. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez ordered a countywide curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. starting Friday and said it would be effective until further notice. He also ordered entertainment venues, including movie theaters and casinos, to close again after reopening in May. “The curfew is meant to stop people from venturing out and hanging out with friends in groups, which has shown to be spreading the virus rapidly,” the mayor said. Rob Holland, a resident of Lake Worth, Fla., said the recent statewide surge in cases has left him turning down a handful of invitations to Fourth of July barbecues. “I’m going to stay home and cook,” he said. In Canaan, N.Y., Karen Hershey was also planning a low-key holiday—she began the day with a hike and was expecting to have a few people over for an outdoor dinner. That is in marked contrast to her traditional Fourth of July celebration at Tanglewood, the summertime home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in nearby Lenox, Mass. The venue canceled its 2020 season of musical events because of the pandemic. “Watching something like that go away was super sad,” said Ms. Hershey, 55. In Los Angeles County, which has the most cases in the country according to Johns Hopkins, Fourth of July fireworks were canceled and beaches were closed. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged residents to stay home. “We’re going to have to celebrate differently this year,” the Democrat wrote on Twitter. “Everyone should cancel plans with others for the Fourth of July. You shouldn’t gather with anyone who doesn’t live in your household.” California beach closures put a damper on many holiday plans. Colin Baugh, of Newport Beach, normally heads to the shore on the Fourth, but had to change plans. “The reason you live here is to be by the beach,” the 43-year-old said. “Without it, it feels like something essential is missing.” In places where events were still planned, they often included measures to limit crowds. The annual Macy Inc.’s fireworks show in New York City was taking place as five-minute displays throughout the week in unannounced locations to prevent viewers from congregating. For many businesses, already struggling after months of shutdowns, the holiday weekend has brought extra cost. Eric Miller, the chef and operating partner at Silver Lining Diner, a restaurant in New York’s tony Hamptons community, said the Fourth of July would normally bring a steady flow of customers, as well as the chance to cater as many as 20 large events. But this year, Mr. Miller expects a small number of patrons—he has limited himself to only offering outdoor dining because of safety concerns—and he has just five catering orders. “Nobody in their right mind is gathering in groups,” he said. Mr. Trump on Saturday signed into law a bill extending the timeline for small businesses to apply for forgivable loans. The bill extending the Paycheck Protection Program passed the House and the Senate this week. In Washington, D.C., protests calling for racial justice and equality in the wake of George Floyd’s killing took place at several locations in the city, according to local media reports. Similar protests had been planned in other major metropolitan areas, including Chicago and Los Angeles. World-wide, confirmed coronavirus cases exceeded 11.1 million, with nearly 528,000 deaths. India, one of the worst-hit nations, on Saturday reported a single-day record of 22,771 new cases, bringing the nation’s total to 648,315, data from the country’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare showed. In Australia, the southern state of Victoria reported 108 new cases Saturday—its second-highest daily increase and biggest jump since late March. The growing number of infections has led to officials urging residents in designated “hot zones” to stay at home. Across England, pubs, restaurants, libraries, museums, cinemas and hairdressers opened for the first time in more than three months. Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to behave responsibly. “As pubs and restaurants open across England today, it is absolutely vital that everyone follows the rules on social distancing,” he tweeted. With more than 44,000 people across the U.K. having died from Covid-19, many people took to social media to say they wouldn’t be going because it was happening too soon. Pubs haven’t opened everywhere in the U.K., as the governments in Scotland and Wales take a more cautious approach to ending restrictions. For all the pandemic-related cancellations of holiday events in the U.S., the Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest—a Fourth of July tradition at Brooklyn’s Coney Island going back decades—was able to take place, albeit without the usual crowd of cheering spectators because of safety restrictions. This year’s winners set world records. Returning 12-time men’s champ Joey Chestnut, considered the most dominant competitor in the history of the sport, devoured 75 hot dogs in 10 minutes, easily surpassing other contestants in the men’s division. Similarly, Miki Sudo, another frequent past victor, beat her fellow eaters on the women’s side with a mark of 48.5 hot dogs. For the first time in recent memory, the event, which was televised live on ESPN, was held indoors in an undisclosed Coney Island location with minimal spectators. So while competitors didn’t have the masses for support, they had the benefit of not chomping down in the midday heat. “Being inside helped,” Mr. Chestnut said on ESPN after his record-breaking victory.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.039,0.878,0.083,0.9951
July4th,WSJ,2024,"Andrew Restuccia, Ken Thomas",https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/pressure-on-biden-builds-as-democrats-fear-big-november-losses-a87849f3?mod=Searchresults_pos4&page=2,Biden Moves to Shore Up Support as Democratic Unity Cracks,"WASHINGTON—President Biden polled allies about what he can do to recapture the support of his party as he scrambled to keep his place at the top of the ticket amid deepening fissures in Democratic unity. Over the last 48 hours, Biden has called Democratic congressional leaders as well as his biggest allies in Congress, part of an all-hands effort by the president and his senior advisers to reassure lawmakers, boost party morale and convince skeptics that he is capable of serving another four years in office. Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), who spoke to Biden on Tuesday, said in an interview that the president was “determined to beat Donald Trump,” and was seeking advice and input in light of his debate performance, asking “how do you rebuild confidence?” Coons said he urged Biden to do an unscripted event like a town hall “where the average American can just see his engagement and agility and capacity.” Biden, he said, was receptive to the idea. Biden has acknowledged privately that the coming days will be crucial and that he has to prove himself to the American people, according to a person who spoke to him. One of his biggest tests will be a Friday interview with ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos, a former Clinton White House aide who has been with ABC for more than two decades. The recorded interview will air in full on Friday night, according to ABC. But senior Democrats said Biden and his team had more work to do to assuage their concerns following a disastrous debate that left many in the party worried about the president’s mental acuity. Some prominent members of the president’s party have called for Vice President Kamala Harris to step in to replace him. The White House told reporters Wednesday that Biden hadn’t had any additional medical exams since his February physical exam. But White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said Thursday that “several days” following the debate, “the president was seen to check on his cold and was recovering well.” Democratic lawmakers continued to raise deep concerns in private about Biden remaining on the ticket, and they said their worries are only increasing. Three lawmakers said they were hunkering down and waiting for Biden to either change course or for election polling to come out that could make sticking with the president untenable. “People are getting more worried,” one Democratic lawmaker said. Some have expressed anger at Biden’s team for, in their view, being dismissive of their concerns about the age-related issues that the president has been grappling with behind the scenes. “The campaign has come off as extremely arrogant in the way it has responded to legitimate questions about President Biden’s capacity as a candidate. Calling us bed-wetters or Davos Democrats is out of bounds,” said Rep. Scott Peters (D., Calif.). Peters put Biden’s campaign on notice, suggesting that there could be consequences if they don’t address lawmakers’ concerns. “This campaign damn well better tell us how they expect to win it—if they don’t tell me that this week, call me back next week,” he said. Some Democratic lawmakers have considered sending Biden letters calling for him to step down as the party’s nominee, according to several people familiar with the talks. Progressive lawmakers from the party’s left flank discussed a letter, and vulnerable Democrats facing competitive races talked about a separate letter, the people said. Amid the wave of criticism, Biden remained defiant. “Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can—and as simply and straightforward as I can,” Biden told his campaign staff on Wednesday, according to people with knowledge of his remarks. “I am running. I’m the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one’s pushing me out. I’m not leaving.” A Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday found that Trump has opened a 6-point lead over Biden among voters nationally, with 80% saying the president is too old to run for a second term. The share of voters who say Biden is too old to run rose 7 points from the Journal’s survey in February. The Journal’s new poll was conducted in the days after the president’s disastrous debate last week against Trump. One day after the first Democratic member of Congress—Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett—called on Biden to withdraw, other lawmakers were raising concerns about the fallout of the president continuing to be the Democratic nominee. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D., Ariz.) told the New York Times that Biden should step aside. Two Democrats from Trump-leaning districts, Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, said they thought Trump would win the election if Biden were the nominee. Former Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio) said that Harris should replace Biden. “We have a great candidate. She’s done a phenomenal job,” Ryan said of Harris in an interview. “I think she’d be attractive to a lot of working-class people in the middle-class Midwest once they get to know her.” Ryan said he has been frustrated by Biden allies’ decision to “dig in and ask everybody to pretend like we didn’t see what we saw.” Trump, he worries, will win if Biden stays on the ticket. Former President Barack Obama has fielded calls from worried Democrats in the days following the debate and acknowledged in those conversations that Biden’s re-election path has become more challenging, according to a person familiar with the talks. In a note to clients Wednesday, Sarah Bianchi, a former Biden administration trade official who is now a senior managing director at the investment banking firm Evercore, wrote, “[W]e now think the probability that President Biden withdraws from the race in the coming days has risen above 60%.” Bianchi has longstanding ties to Biden, serving as his policy director when he was vice president. In an interview, Bianchi said she has “complete confidence in President Biden, who has been the best president in my lifetime, and believes that he will conduct a process to make the right decision for him and the country.” The president met for an hour on Wednesday night in the West Wing with roughly two dozen Democratic governors. After the meeting, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said the governors had an honest and candid conversation with Biden. “We were honest about the feedback that we were getting,” Moore said. “We were honest about the concerns that we’re hearing.” Moore added that Biden told them he was “all-in, and we said we would stand with him.” Biden’s evening meeting had a number of Democratic governors attending in person, including Moore, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, all of whom are said to have national ambitions, along with other governors participating virtually. The meeting was organized by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. Biden’s advisers are keeping close tabs on the public comments of Democrats who have been discussed as possible candidates to step in if Biden withdraws, according to people familiar with the matter. Biden’s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, held an afternoon all-staff call in a bid to boost flagging White House morale following the debate. On the call, which was described by people who participated, Zients encouraged staff to focus on their work, hold their heads high and tune out the noise. The president spoke on Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), Rep. James Clyburn (D., S.C.) and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), and he had calls Tuesday with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) and Coons, the White House said. The president scheduled a cabinet meeting Wednesday to talk to his agency heads in the wake of the debate, according to two people familiar with the plans. That meeting was scratched after it became clear that too many cabinet secretaries were out of town for the Fourth of July holiday. Biden and his team have offered varying excuses for his poor debate performance, including that he was suffering from a cold and jet lag. At a Virginia fundraiser Tuesday night, Biden said he “wasn’t very smart” before the debate because he kept a busy travel schedule. Biden did, however, spend roughly a week at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, preparing for the debate following his return from trips to France and Italy. Asked about those comments Wednesday, Jean-Pierre told reporters, “He wished he could have done better and so he took ownership. He’s going to continue to make a strong case for his agenda and that’s what you’re going to see. Meanwhile, Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political-analysis group run by the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said Wednesday that Biden’s “debate performance was so bad that it has forced us to reassess some of our assumptions about the race.” The group projected that Michigan and Minnesota are now more competitive for Republicans. Biden is scheduled Friday to hold a campaign event in Madison, Wis. The state’s Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin, won’t join Biden at the Friday event, according to a spokesman for her campaign, who said she would be on a previously scheduled listening tour throughout the state. In internal memos reviewed by the Journal, Biden’s senior campaign officials played down the debate’s effect on public opinion. “Our internal battleground toplines from last night show a steady race: we estimate that we’re down just 1 point in margin. All of this is well within the margin of error and shows a steady race,” they said in a memo sent to Capitol Hill allies on Wednesday.",0.0,0.769,0.231,0.4019,0.05,0.869,0.082,0.9931
July4th,WSJ,2024,Kimberley Strassel,https://www.wsj.com/articles/about-that-democratic-panic-biden-decline-aging-presidential-election-581ae8f3,About the Democratic Panic,"Never rely on a politician to do the right thing for country or party. Always rely on a politician to do the right thing for himself. And witness the sudden and overdue Democratic acknowledgment that Joe Biden isn’t up to the job. The 81-year-old Mr. Biden’s fitness wasn’t a worry to Democrats when he was AWOL from consequential domestic policy debates. Or when special counsel Robert Hur described him as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” Or when his doddering condition shocked allies at last month’s Group of Seven summit. Or even when his (and note, only his) poll numbers kept falling. The White House scorned or accused critics of taking cheap shots, while Democrats attested to Mr. Biden’s “sharp” mind, boundless “energy” and obvious “competence.” Then Mr. Biden broadcast to the world a 90-minute debate showcasing the alarming depths of his deterioration, exposing this Democratic fiction. And the polls began to roll in, showing signs that Mr. Biden’s bad numbers are becoming a liability to vulnerable Senate and House Democrats, not to mention governors, attorneys general, and state legislative candidates. So now? Now Democrats are worried. Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett on Tuesday became the first elected Congressional Democrat to “respectfully” call on Mr. Biden to withdraw from the race. Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, fighting one of the tightest House races in the country, did the functional equivalent with an op-ed that explained it didn’t matter what Mr. Biden did after his “poor performance” because it has been clear for months that “Donald Trump is going to win.” An unidentified House Democratic lawmaker told CNN that his caucus wants “to give [Mr. Biden] space to make a decision [to step aside], but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn’t.” More calculating Democrats are readying lifeboats, should ship abandonment become necessary. Democratic governors publicly sought a Wednesday meeting with the president to air concerns. Sen. Peter Welch (D., Vt.) publicly reprimanded the Biden campaign for its “dismissive attitude” toward the worried. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi conceded it was “legitimate” to ask if Mr. Biden had an episode or a . . . “condition.” South Carolina’s Rep. Jim Clyburn said he’d support Kamala Harris . . . should Mr. Biden make way. And Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) said Democrats want reassurance that the debate was a “real anomaly, and not just the way he is these days.” If Mr. Whitehouse feels the need to cover his bases in blue Rhode Island, panic really has set in. The polls merit this alarm. We’re now getting the first post-debate surveys and, while the top-line gains for Mr. Trump are mixed, the internals for Mr. Biden and the Democratic Party are uniformly abysmal and getting worse. Numerous polls show Mr. Biden’s approval rating at all-time or near-to-all-time lows. A WSJ poll shows that 80% of voters now say the incumbent is too old to run, while several polls show a growing number of Democrats want him replaced at the top of the ticket. Mr. Biden’s poll numbers were already bad, but Democratic candidates had worked hard to separate their fate from his. Between a focus on local issues and strategic criticism of Biden policy, most Democratic Senate incumbents have retained their leads over challengers, and House Democrats still have the opportunity to take the majority. But Republicans now have a new opportunity to tie the Biden anchor to Democratic legs. They are already running commercials pairing clips of their opponents attesting to Mr. Biden’s mental acuity with clips of his debate meltdown. Democrats’ real fear is the yawning enthusiasm gap, which has increased alongside debate fallout. A new USAToday/Suffolk University poll shows nearly 60% of Trump voters are “very excited” to vote for him, versus nearly 30% for Biden. About 17% of Trump voters were “not very” or “not at all” excited to pull the lever for their guy; Mr. Biden’s number is approaching 40%. Democratic base voters who can’t be bothered to come out to vote for a president won’t be there for downballot candidates either. The White House early in the week might have hoped to head off defections. It roared out of Thursday’s debacle with a plan to snuff dissent—marshaling big-name support, dismissing “bedwetters,” releasing a new ad, calming donors. But the initial muted reaction from elected Democrats was simply the calm before the polls. It was inevitable that once the numbers rolled in, the freakout would escalate. Mr. Biden’s best bet for survival, bizarrely, is to keep warning Democrats that his withdrawal will simply force them to confront other notable mistakes—crowning a barely qualified and unpopular vice president, elevating a bench of uber-progressive governors who will struggle to connect with swing-state voters. It’s a testament to Mr. Biden’s perilous position that even those warnings may not prove enough.",0.524,0.476,0.0,-0.5106,0.092,0.817,0.091,0.0151

But savvier observers might instead regard Mr. Biden’s comment as a “Kinsley gaffe,” one in which a politician unintentionally reveals a larger truth: Elected Democrats, including Mr. Biden, have spent decades trying not only to “beat Medicare” but to abolish it. Consider the single-payer healthcare legislation introduced repeatedly by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.). The bill states that “no benefits shall be available under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act”—which establishes Medicare—once the single-payer program goes into effect, and it provides for the dissolution of the Medicare trust funds. As I noted in these pages in 2018, these provisions make the bill not “Medicare for All,” as Mr. Sanders claims, but “Medicare for None. The 2020 presidential primaries showed that many other Democrats also supported abolishing Medicare. Senators including Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) co-sponsored Mr. Sanders’s “Medicare for None” bill, although Ms. Harris later executed a series of political flip-flops over single-payer that helped doom her presidential campaign. Likewise, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), whom Democrats would make the next speaker of the House, supported the House version of Mr. Sanders’s proposal to abolish Medicare in 2019. Democrats’ desire to abolish Medicare is hardly a recent development. The American Health Security Act in 1993 provided for a single-payer program that, like Mr. Sanders’s proposal, would have ended benefits under Medicare and diverted any amounts remaining in the Medicare trust funds to the new program. Among the House bill’s co-sponsors: Chuck Schumer, now the Senate majority leader; Xavier Becerra, now the secretary of health and human services; and Nancy Pelosi, who publicly demanded a House vote on the legislation. Joe Biden’s history of seeking to abolish Medicare goes all the way back to 1975. That year, the then-freshman senator introduced so-called “sunset” legislation to terminate within six years “all provisions of law in effect . . . which authorize new budget authority for an unspecified number of fiscal years”—and to limit all new laws to authorize only four years of spending. Budget experts have confirmed that, as written and without further congressional action, the bill would have sunset the Medicare and Social Security programs, which is exactly what now-President Biden has alleged Republicans want to do. Medicare has serious sustainability issues, and it needs reform to remain solvent in the long term. But Democratic proposals to end Medicare and create a single-payer system would simply exacerbate the federal government’s unsustainable spending problems. Using Medicare funds allocated for seniors to finance “free” healthcare for all Americans, including billionaires such as Mark Zuckerberg, sounds like the kind of political attack Democrats would mount against Republicans. When leveled against Democrats, however, it has the added benefit of being true. Joe Biden may not remember his legislation sunsetting Medicare and Social Security, and Democrats may wish to forget how they have used Medicare as a piggy bank to fund other government spending. But voters should recall that Democrats have truly sought to “beat Medicare” time and again.",0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404,0.037,0.843,0.12,0.9934

Wade’,"President Biden last week urged the U.S. Senate to abolish the filibuster so that Congress can “codify Roe v. Wade.” But the filibuster’s 60-vote requirement isn’t the most serious impediment to the Women’s Health Protection Act, a Democratic bill that passed the House, or for that matter to Republican Sen. Susan Collins’s more modest Reproductive Choice Act. The most serious impediment is the Constitution.The Constitution is silent on abortion, as the Supreme Court held last month in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. But it speaks clearly about the limits on congressional power. The most recent version of the Women’s Health Protection Act doesn’t cite any source of congressional authority, but earlier versions pointed to Section 5 of the 14th Amendment and Article I’s Commerce Clause. Both are dead ends. Section 5 gives Congress the power to enforce the 14th Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. But in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), the court emphasized that Section 5 wouldn’t permit Congress to alter the 14th Amendment’s substance. The court found that Section 5 wouldn’t permit Congress to impose on states the Religious Freedom Restoration Act’s rigorous test for regulations infringing on religious exercise. The same rationale precludes Congress from using Section 5 to breathe life back into Roe. In overturning Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), the justices held that the Due Process Clause doesn’t guarantee women the right to choose abortion. Dobbs effectively foreclosed Equal Protection challenges to abortion restrictions as well. Thus, with regard to abortion, the Constitution leaves the states with the same broad discretion they have to regulate other aspects of medical practice. Congress can’t use Section 5 to change that. The Commerce Clause likewise is of no avail. To be sure, the court has interpreted Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce broadly. The justices have upheld, among other things, federal regulation of the price of milk produced and sold exclusively within a single state and restrictions on the production of wheat for a farmer’s own use. But the Commerce Clause has limits. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), five justices determined that Congress can’t use its commerce power to compel individuals to engage in commerce. Congress similarly can’t force a state to allow a healthcare provider to offer abortion services on congressional terms. In the License Tax Cases (1866), the court emphasized that “the power to authorize a business within a State is plainly repugnant to the exclusive power of the State over the same subject.” States get to decide whether and to what extent they permit abortion within their borders. In Linder v. U.S. (1925), the court stated that “direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government.” In Gonzales v. Raich (2005), the court held that Congress could regulate the practice of medicine indirectly “as an essential part of a larger regulation” designed to combat drug trafficking, but these abortion bills attempt to regulate medical practice directly. Federal abortion-rights legislation would impermissibly encroach on a state’s prerogative to define what is criminal within its borders. The plurality in Screws v. U.S. (1945) explained that “under our federal system the administration of criminal justice rests with the States except as Congress, acting within the scope of [its] delegated powers, has created offenses against the United States.” The upshot of this is that Congress may not legalize performing an abortion within a state when the state has decided to punish that conduct as criminal. Legalization isn’t regulation. What about restrictions? Could Congress impose a nationwide ban? In Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), the justices upheld a federal ban on partial-birth abortion. Yet what Linder states about control over medical practice arguably would apply equally to a nationwide ban or lesser restrictions. Justice Clarence Thomas, concurring in Carhart, noted that the case didn’t raise the question whether the law “constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.” He has repeatedly called on the court to reconsider its Commerce Clause jurisprudence, contending in U.S. v. Morrison (2000) that the courts’ “rootless and malleable standard . . . has encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits.” Whether Justice Thomas’s colleagues will accept his invitation, and what that might mean for federal laws restricting abortion, is an open question. As the court reminded President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. U.S. (1935), federal officials “are not at liberty to transcend imposed limits because they believe that more or different power is necessary.” The Constitution doesn’t empower Congress to force states to allow abortion against their wishes. What Mr. Biden said about the Covid pandemic applies to legislating abortion rights: “There is no federal solution.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.091,0.828,0.081,-0.9053

Each day we’re reminded there is nothing guaranteed about our democracy. Nothing guaranteed about our way of life,” Mr. Biden said. “We have to fight for it, defend it and earn it by voting.” The president appeared to reference the Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right to an abortion. “In recent days, there has been reason to think that this country is moving backward, that freedom is being reduced, that rights we assumed are protected are no longer,” Mr. Biden said. He spoke about an “ongoing battle for the soul of America,” one of his 2020 campaign themes, and said, “I know it can be exhausting and unsettling but tonight, I want you to know that we are going to get through this.” Mr. Biden said that while many Americans remain concerned about the divisions in the country, “I believe it’s a choice we make and I believe it’s within our power to choose unity and unity of purpose.” Later in the evening, Mr. Biden asked the audience to share a moment of silence in honor of the victims in Illinois, and told the audience that authorities had identified a suspect. “We got a lot more work to do. We got to get this under control,” Mr. Biden said. Mr. Biden said in a statement before his remarks that he had spoken with Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, and that he was providing federal assistance. The shooting came more than a week after the president signed a bipartisan firearms package into law in response to deadly shootings in New York, Texas and other parts of the country during the spring. The law requires that background checks cover the juvenile and mental-health records of gun purchasers under 21 years of age. It encourages states to enact extreme risk protection orders, also known as red-flag laws, to allow courts to order guns to be temporarily removed from people deemed dangerous. And it imposes new criminal penalties on straw purchases, or buying a gun for someone not permitted to, and gun trafficking.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.099,0.837,0.063,-0.9313

In Virginia opponents of the Court’s decision proudly called this “massive resistance,” and a decade of social strife followed. These days the massive resistance is on the political left, as exemplified by New York state’s new gun law that defies the Supreme Court’s late June ruling solidifying individual gun rights. Police were still hunting Monday evening for the shooter at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill., who killed at least six spectators as this was being written. The shooter reportedly used a rifle from a rooftop, which betrays premeditated malevolence. The shooting underscores the need to keep guns away from the mentally disturbed or those who are a danger to the community. The recent bill passed by Congress is a good-faith effort to do that, and we supported it. But that doesn’t justify the refusal by politicians to respect the right of the law-abiding to bear arms for self-defense as interpreted by the Supreme Court. The New York Legislature appears to have paid little heed to the High Court’s ruling that overturned its gun-licensing regime in New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn. v. Bruen. Prodded by Gov. Kathy Hochul, the state Senate (43-20) and Assembly (91-51) voted last week to pass a new gun law that ignores Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion. Gov. Hochul boasted shortly after the ruling came down that the state would do this, having had barely enough time to read it, much less digest its legal implications. This will probably turn out to be a legal mistake, since challengers to the new law will cite her comments as a sign that the state made no attempt to follow the Court’s commands.The High Court ruled in Bruen that the right to bear arms extends outside the home for self-defense. The new law seeks to vitiate this right by exploiting a passage in the opinion that allows gun restrictions in “sensitive places,” such as schools and government buildings. Bruen doesn’t define sensitive places with much specificity. But the majority’s 6-3 opinion warns that “expanding the category of ‘sensitive places’ simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the category of ‘sensitive places’ far too broadly” and would “eviscerate the general right to publicly carry arms for self-defense.” The new New York statute ignores this clear direction. It defines sensitive places to include airports, bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, courthouses, day-care facilities, playgrounds, parks, zoos, schools, entertainment venues, government buildings, houses of worship, libraries, public demonstrations and rallies, public transportation including subways and buses, and even Times Square. The law also deems “no carry” as the default on private property unless declared permissible by the owners. Private property owners who allow concealed carry will have to publicly display this in signs, which may have free-speech implications. All of this goes a long way to defining most of New York City as off-limits to concealed carry. Subways are increasingly dangerous because of illegal guns and lax law enforcement, but passengers won’t be able to protect themselves with a legal gun. Walking with a gun on the streets will be illegal if you wander into Central Park or public squares where civilians are assaulted too often. The law also defines what it means to have the “good moral character” required to obtain a gun permit. A New York Senate press release says this means having the “essential character, temperament, and judgment necessary to be entrusted with a weapon.” This will presumably be in the eye of the bureaucratic beholder. It gives too much discretion to the government to deny a fundamental right, which is one reason the Court struck down the state’s licensing regime in Bruen. All of this looks like a willful attempt to defy a Supreme Court ruling. The same progressives appalled when Southern politicians stood in the schoolhouse door to block racial integration are now standing in the licensing office to prevent New Yorkers from exercising their constitutional right to bear arms. That many of these New Yorkers will be minorities seeking to protect themselves in high-crime neighborhoods doesn’t seem to matter to the massive resisters who run New York.",0.0,0.714,0.286,0.5574,0.102,0.816,0.082,-0.9589

But two heat waves on each side of the United States will make this holiday weekend an even more memorable scorcher for tens of millions of Americans, with less relief than usual at night. The western region is in the middle of a long-term heat wave that could last well through the holiday weekend, while the Southern Plains to the Southeast Gulf Coast will swelter in humid heat. Rain is more likely across the middle of the country, from the Northern Plains through the Midwest and into the Mid-Atlantic. Here is some of what to expect — and where. Across the Northeast, slightly abnormal heat will build on Thursday and last through the weekend. This is not expected to be the same level of heat experienced during the June heat wave, but it will still be a sticky heat. As contestants choke down hot dogs at Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Long Island on Thursday — absent longtime champion Joey Chestnut — there is only a slight, 30 percent chance of rain. This percentage will increase in the Northeast as the weekend progresses. The South won’t be as lucky and will continue to see high, humid heat, which is more typical of the end of July than the beginning. As thousands of runners lace up their shoes to begin Atlanta’s 55th running of The AJC Peachtree Road Race at 7 a.m. on Thursday, it will feel like 77 degrees at the starting line. As the last runners cross the finish line later that morning, it will feel like the mid-90s. By the afternoon, as in other locations across the South, temperatures combined with humidity will make it feel more like the upper 90s, if not the 100s. That’s a trend that will continue through the long weekend. Track Extreme Weather Risks. There is some relief to be found. While much of the country will have temperatures above average for this time of the year, areas from the Northern Rockies into the Northern and Central Plains will see cooler-than-average temperatures. Places like Chicago may have morning rain on Thursday. Although there is a slight chance of an afternoon thunderstorm, it will likely be dry. The upper Midwest, especially Minnesota and Northern Iowa, is most at risk for rainfall on Thursday. This is the one spot that doesn’t need any more, as rivers are still under flood warnings after persistent rains this past month. Out West, the long heat wave will push desert temperatures well past 100. The persistent heat will cause hazardous conditions not only on Thursday but also through the weekend and into next week. The only relief may come from joining others on another 4th of July pass time and hanging at the beach; even then, it might not be as much relief as typical.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.024,0.857,0.118,0.9942

No, not fireworks, sweaty subway rides and family cookouts. It was time for the Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in Coney Island. The contest has long been a holiday mainstay in New York, and its worldwide television exposure has made celebrities of its most famous champions. But this year’s event, which tests “competitive eaters” on how many hot dogs they can frantically scarf down in 10 minutes, crowned a new men’s champion for the first time in almost a generation and witnessed a new women’s record. Patrick Bertoletti, 39, from Chicago, snagged the men’s title — or, in the parlance of Coney Island, the Mustard Belt — by eating 58 hot dogs in 10 minutes, while Miki Sudo, 38, ate 51 hot dogs, setting a new women’s record. The former men’s champion, Joey Chestnut, 40, won the competition 16 times but was barred from entering after a falling out with the organizers. Mr. Bertoletti was the world’s ninth-ranked eater before the competition, according to Major League Eating, and he bested several competitors promoted by event organizers as Mr. Chestnut’s potential successors. “Always a bridesmaid and never a bride,” Mr. Bertoletti said afterward. “But today I am getting married.” He described winning as a life-changing event. “With Joey not here I knew I had a shot,” he said, referring to Mr. Chestnut. “I was able to unlock something and I don’t know where it came from.” Mr. Chestnut parted ways with the contest last month after he signed an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods, a rival to Nathan’s that makes vegan hot dogs. But he loomed large over Thursday’s proceedings, in one case literally: A huge Pepsi ad bearing his image hung just one block from the contest location. Many of the spectators also wore Chestnut memorabilia and chanted or held up signs pleading for his return. Mark Sterling, 35, did brisk business selling Chestnut bobblehead dolls to the crowd for $35. “Why would you not want a bobblehead of a legend?” said Mr. Sterling, from the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. “Joey Chestnut not being here is like people saying Derek Jeter’s not at Yankee Stadium anymore — people still love him.” Many viewers tuned in year after year just to watch Mr. Chestnut go through a pile of hot dogs like a wood chipper. News of his departure from the contest was met with the sort of public anguish one might expect for a major-league baseball player, not a man who ate 62 hot dogs in 10 minutes last July 4. At the women’s contest on Thursday, Ms. Sudo easily won the title for the 10th time, besting a group of competitors, some of whom traveled to Coney Island from as far as Japan and South Korea. She ate 51 hot dogs in 10 minutes, setting a new women’s record and exceeding her 2023 total of 39.5 hot dogs. The runner-up, Mayoi Ebihara of Japan, ate 37 hot dogs. As Ms. Sudo ate hot dogs two at a time, an ESPN announcer was inspired to opine, “Her style is like the prose of Eudora Welty,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning 20th-century novelist not known to have enjoyed 51 hot dogs in one sitting. After winning, Ms. Sudo thanked her family and the dental school in Tampa where she is studying to be a dental hygienist, and reflected on the pressures of being a mother, a student and a world-famous hot dog eater. “You feel like you’re juggling,” she said, “You try your best to balance everything.” George Shea, the event’s larger-than-life M.C., described Ms. Sudo as a woman whose “soul shines like magnesium set afire against the dark mountain of night.” Nonna Titulauri, 31, a banking intern who lives in the East Village, said she was thrilled to witness a new women’s world record. But her friend Christina DeCarlo was less amused.“It’s kinda gross,” said Ms. DeCarlo, 33, a project manager who lives in Midtown. “I just want to understand, who decided it’s a thing? In an interview last month, Mr. Shea, a charismatic showman who helped elevate this whole spectacle into the sort of event that is covered by The New York Times, said he was “devastated” by the Chestnut situation. Even Senator Chuck Schumer, a Brooklyn native, mourned what he called “‘impossibly’ hard-to-swallow news.” Mr. Shea said Mr. Chestnut’s endorsement deal had left Major League Eating, which bills itself as “the governing body of all stomach-centric sport,” with no choice but to bar him. “It would be like back in the day Michael Jordan coming to Nike, who made his Air Jordans, and saying, ‘I am just going to rep Adidas too,’” Mr. Shea said. “It just can’t happen.” The hot dog eating contest is the sort of absurd public event for which New York City has long been known. Over the years, it has developed its own lore, canon and epic heroes, of whom Mr. Chestnut was long the king. According to local legend, the contest has been held each year since 1916, when Nathan Handwerker opened a hot dog joint on the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island. But like many legends, this one is mostly myth. The contest actually began in the early 1970s, and in 2010, one of its original promoters, Mortimer Matz, admitted that he had cooked up the origin story in “Coney Island pitchman style.” In recent years, the event has been powered largely by the wiener puns and theatrical patriotism of Mr. Shea, who calls it “a celebration of freedom,” and by the star power of Mr. Chestnut. The contest made him famous, and he in turn became synonymous with the event. As the weigh-in ceremony began on Wednesday, Mr. Shea repeated the tale of Mr. Chestnut’s departure for the crowd, before reassuring them that he would be welcome to return to the Coney Island event at any time. Representatives for Mr. Chestnut did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. For those who still wished to watch Mr. Chestnut eat an unsettling number of hot dogs on July 4, he traveled to Fort Bliss, in El Paso, to compete against soldiers in a five-minute hot dog eating contest. The event was streamed live on Mr. Chestnut’s YouTube channel, where 22,000 viewers watched him eat 57 hot dogs in front of a crowd that looked more like a town fair gathering than the flashy Coney Island event. Mr. Chestnut will also headline a hot dog eating contest on Labor Day that will stream live on Netflix, along with Takeru Kobayashi, another former July 4 hot dog champion who was ejected from the Coney Island contest in 2010 after a falling out with Major League Eating. Mr. Chestnut’s trajectory may have taken him out of the Nathan’s competition — for now, at least — but James Webb, a former professional soccer player from Australia who began competitive eating “as a joke,” said in an interview on Wednesday that some version of his celebrity status is what everyone in the contest hoped to achieve. Mr. Webb placed third Thursday by eating 51.75 hot dogs. “We are all weird,” said Mr. Webb, as a person in a giant hot dog costume danced nearby for TV cameras lined up beneath the Vessel in Hudson Yards. “We are all weird in our way. But we are hella competitive and pretty disciplined. And that’s kind of the part people don’t see.”",0.0,0.719,0.281,0.5994,0.026,0.857,0.117,0.9991
July4th,NYT,2020,Michael Gold,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/01/us/politics/trump-pickens-independence-day.html?searchResultPosition=33,"A Small Town’s Fourth of July: Flags, a 5K and Trump’s Attacks on American Institutions","Former President Donald J. Trump drew a crowd of thousands on Saturday to a quiet South Carolina town’s Independence Day event, where he assailed the integrity of major American institutions and painted a dark portrait of the country ahead of a holiday meant to celebrate its underpinnings. Speaking for nearly 90 minutes on Main Street in Pickens, S.C., with at least 20 American flags behind his back, Mr. Trump often eschewed the rhetorical flag-waving and calls for unity that have long been as central to Independence Day as hot dogs, baseball and fireworks. Instead, the twice-impeached and twice-indicted former president railed against Democrats and liberals, who he said threatened to rewrite America’s past and erase its future. He skewered federal law enforcement, which he accused without evidence of rampant corruption. And he attacked President Biden, enumerating what he saw as his character flaws and accusing him of taking bribes from foreign nations. “We want to have a respect for our country and for the office” of the presidency, Mr. Trump said. “But we really have no interest in people who are sick.” Mr. Trump’s comments were largely familiar. But the event highlighted the hold he has on his most fervent supporters — a challenge for his Republican rivals as they seek their party’s presidential nomination from far behind Mr. Trump in the polls. Despite sweltering humidity and heat, thousands of people swarmed the streets of Pickens — a town of about 3,000 in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains — beginning at dawn. Pam Nichols, who described herself as an “insurrectionist,” said that she flew from Mundelein, Ill., to proudly support Mr. Trump in person. She had last done so in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, she said, when a mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol building. She did not talk in detail about her actions that day. “I was told to lay low after,” Ms. Nichols said, adding that she had watched a number of Mr. Trump’s speeches online since. “But I felt like it’s time to come out now. I’m tired of laying low.” The event in Pickens was only Mr. Trump’s second full-scale rally since he kicked off his campaign in November. Though such rallies were a hallmark of his past two campaigns, he has so far largely taken the stage at events organized by other groups. Bryan Owens, the director of marketing for Pickens, said that a representative for the Trump campaign reached out two weeks ago to ask to come to the town for its Independence Day celebration. South Carolina, an early nominating state, was a key victory for Mr. Trump in the 2016 primaries as he sought to unite the Republican Party behind him. In 2020, he won the state handily, drawing overwhelming support in this region, a conservative swath of 10 counties in the northwest corner known as the Upstate. Mr. Owens said that the town’s decision was easy. Though he personally would not support Mr. Trump in 2024, he said, the opportunity to bring a former president to Pickens was too good to pass up. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime event for Pickens,” Mr. Owens continued, gesturing behind him to a crowd that packed the streets and stretched for several blocks. “And people that aren’t that familiar with small towns — they’ll get that experience.” Pickens’s Independence Day festivities began with a 5K race to raise money to repair water fountains on a local nature trail. American flags lined the streets, and signs encouraged visitors to shop local, even as businesses on Main Street were closed because of Secret Service measures. With parking near the site of the rally limited, residents were charging up to $100 — cash, many were quick to clarify — to let visitors leave cars in their driveways or on their lawns. For another $20, a golf cart might shuttle you from your car toward the rally’s entrance, outside a McDonald’s at the end of Main Street. Red, white and blue were the wardrobe colors of the day, from hat to boots. Tammy Milligan, of Myrtle Beach, S.C., arrived dressed in a Wonder Woman costume, which she said she started wearing around the time of Mr. Trump’s first impeachment in 2019. Even as she stood behind Mr. Trump wholeheartedly and called him a patriot, she acknowledged that much of the country felt differently — which she framed as an American ideal. “Well, everyone’s entitled to think what they want to think,” Ms. Milligan said. “That’s our country.” Mr. Trump was not so generous. He dwelled on the federal indictment that charged him with illegally retaining national security documents and obstructing the government’s efforts to reclaim them. And even as he denounced the prosecution as an egregious and politically motivated step, he vowed, as he has before, that he would reciprocate in kind if elected. Outlining a dark vision of America, Mr. Trump called his political opponents “sick people” and “degenerates” who were “running our country to the ground.”",0.195,0.805,0.0,-0.4404,0.036,0.848,0.115,0.9971
July4th,NYT,2023,Bret Stephens,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/opinion/july-4-lincoln-democracy.html?searchResultPosition=31,What We Celebrate When We Celebrate the Fourth of July,"In the spring of 1859, Abraham Lincoln was invited by a committee of Boston Republicans to attend a festival in honor of Thomas Jefferson’s birthday. He couldn’t make it. Instead, he sent a letter that explains, perhaps better than anything else Lincoln wrote except for the Gettysburg Address, what it is that we celebrate when we celebrate the Fourth of July. Lincoln began by noting a historical irony: Roughly 70 years earlier, America’s two main political parties had gotten their start. At the time, it was the party of the South, the Democratic-Republicans, that was “formed upon their supposed superior devotion to the personal rights of men,” while it was the party of the North, the Federalists, that was mainly devoted to the rights of property. Things had changed. By the late 1850s, it was Lincoln’s Republicans who held fast to Jeffersonian principles — that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights — while it was the Democrats who “denied and evaded” them. “One dashingly calls them ‘glittering generalities’; another bluntly calls them ‘self-evident lies’; and still others insidiously argue that they apply only to ‘superior races,’” Lincoln noted, in veiled digs at John C. Calhoun and Stephen Douglas. The Democrats of his day held “the liberty of one man to be absolutely nothing, when in conflict with another man’s right of property,” Lincoln wrote. “Republicans, on the contrary, are for both the man and the dollar, but in cases of conflict, the man before the dollar.” One can argue with Lincoln’s sense of history: Jefferson and other leading Democratic-Republicans were mostly slaveholders. Alexander Hamilton, one of the original Federalists, helped found the New York Manumission Society, an early abolitionist group. Lincoln himself almost surely understood this. A line in his letter — “he who would be no slave, must consent to have no slave”— comes across as a thinly disguised critique of Jefferson as a man. But Lincoln’s letter has a larger political and philosophical purpose than pointing out Jefferson’s profound moral shortcomings. In the years before the Civil War, Lincoln was interested in questions of political change, decay and salvation. That parties switch places ideologically should be familiar to us: Democrats were once the party of lower taxes, free trade and segregation; Republicans were once the party of migrant amnesty, moral virtue and being tough on Russia. The larger and more worrying question to Lincoln was whether nations, like parties, could also abandon formerly sacred principles. “It is now no child’s play to save the principles of Jefferson from total overthrow in this nation,” Lincoln warned, just two years before Fort Sumter. “The principles of Jefferson are the definitions and axioms of a free society” — as self-evident, he believed, as “the simpler propositions of Euclid.” The lesson Lincoln drew is how easily a republic could deny its own foundational principles if personal or political self-interest dictated otherwise. America, he warned, was forgoing “free government” for the sake of “classification” and “caste.” Which brought Lincoln to his extraordinary conclusion. ""All honor to Jefferson — to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people, had the coolness, forecast and capacity to introduce into a merely revolutionary document an abstract truth, applicable to all men and all times, and so to embalm it there, that today, and in all coming days, it shall be a rebuke and a stumbling block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and oppression."" What is it, then, that we celebrate on the Fourth of July? Not the long litany of overwrought and misdirected complaints that makes up the bulk of the Declaration of Independence. Not the glaring hypocrisy of men who held others in bondage from the moment of their birth while insisting that all men are born equal. And not the example of those for whom the pursuit of happiness was not a universal ideal. As Lincoln wrote in his letter, “Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and, under a just God, cannot long retain it.” What we celebrate, instead, is a decision: one that would outgrow the circumstances of the American Revolution, outstrip its significance as a historical event and outshine the men who waged it, and perhaps, eventually, will outlive the nation for which it was conceived. It was the remarkable decision by Jefferson and his fellow revolutionaries to do something more than revolutionary: to implant a philosophical truth in a foundational document, so that nobody then or in the future could call himself a patriot or a traditionalist without also subscribing to a universal principle that goes beyond patriotism and tradition. That is why every great champion of freedom looks to our Declaration. That was true of Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke of it as a “promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.” And of the brave protesters in Tiananmen Square, who in 1989 built a 33-foot-tall papier-mâché Goddess of Democracy that recalls the Statue of Liberty before they were gunned down by their own regime. And of Volodymyr Zelensky, who in a Wall Street Journal essay on Sunday compared July 4, 1776, to Feb. 24, 2022, when the Ukrainian people also chose to fight for freedom and independence. When we celebrate the Fourth of July, we celebrate this, just as we give thanks to those who transcended their own failings and prejudices to give us the language of liberty.",0.0,0.519,0.481,0.8126,0.075,0.757,0.168,0.9986

Trump.,"It’s the final Fourth of July before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary — still more than six months away, yes. But all the same, the Republicans vying for their party’s presidential nomination were on the trail, waving to supporters from parades, shaking hands with voters and taking selfies. But not the front-runner: Donald J. Trump was conspicuously absent on the 247th anniversary of the nation’s independence. The former president has upended the traditional expectations of Iowa and New Hampshire voters. For decades they have prided themselves on their discernment of presidential candidates and have demanded to get to know them personally before casting the first ballots in the nation. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign, objected to the notion that the former president is avoiding retail politics over the Fourth of July holiday, pointing to Mr. Trump’s rally in South Carolina on Saturday, which, he said, counted as Independence Day weekend. Mr. Trump also appeared at the Moms for Liberty conference in Philadelphia on Friday, and he even dropped by Pat’s King of Steaks, a cheese steak palace that has been a mainstay for politicians in Philly for decades. And this Friday the former president will be in Council Bluffs, Iowa. But on the actual anniversary of the nation’s birth? “His campaign will have an overwhelming presence in various parades and patriotic events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina,” Mr. Cheung said. Mr. Trump himself, though, planned to spend the day with his family, Mr. Cheung said. “I’m sure people are thankful he’s not out,” former Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a recent entrant in the Republican primary race, quipped outside a pancake breakfast in Merrimack, N.H. “He comes with a lot of baggage.” For early-state Republican voters who hoped for more personal attention on the Fourth, the pickings were plentiful — with the exception of Mr. Trump. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and several other Republican presidential hopefuls spent Tuesday in New Hampshire, while Mike Pence, the former vice president, was in Iowa. Mr. Trump’s campaign evinces no concern that his absence from the stage will give his rivals any room to make up ground in the Republican primaries. After queries about his July 4 plans, his team released a memo Monday afternoon highlighting his campaign’s plans to celebrate the holiday in Iowa and New Hampshire — and calling out his dominant position in Republican primary polling. Republican veterans don’t see much of an opening for Mr. Trump’s rivals either. “He definitely plays by a different set of rules,” said David Kochel, a longtime Republican adviser and strategist in Iowa. Mr. Trump has made some recent adjustments with unscheduled stops at restaurants like Pat’s and, after his arraignment on the first federal felony charges ever levied on a former president, at Versailles, Miami’s beloved Cuban restaurant. He will be appearing with virtually the entire G.O.P. field at the Republican Party of Iowa’s biggest fund-raiser, the Lincoln Dinner, on July 28. “But,” Mr. Kochel said, “his celebrity and the fact that he was president gives him more flexibility.” The retail politics tradition in Iowa and New Hampshire may well be overrated, an artifact of a time before super PACs saturated airwaves, social media reached voters’ phones and celebrity pervaded the zeitgeist, regardless of who was in the diners and pizza joints. “Retail has always been mostly theater, but now it’s all a performance for the cameras, not about meeting regular people and listening to their concerns,” said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee. For someone like Mr. DeSantis, who joined the primary campaign relatively late, appearances like his two July 4 parades do demonstrate that he is putting in the effort and taking New Hampshire seriously, said Mr. Cullen, who is now a Republican consultant in the state. As for the former president, “Can you imagine Trump walking in the Wolfeboro Fourth of July parade?” he asked. “I don’t think so.” Limiting Mr. Trump’s public appearances and emphasizing large rallies over glad-handing with a few dozen supporters may help to preserve the former president’s celebrity and mystique among his faithful while projecting confidence. And Republican primary voters already know how they feel about the former president. His fate in the primary contest may depend more on external factors — like his indictments in two cases and the trials that may ensue, as well as other inquiries he is facing — than on his power of persuasion at an Iowa Pizza Ranch. Mr. Cheung insisted, even as he outlined a relatively sparse schedule for Mr. Trump,“It would be incorrect to write that he will be sparing retail politics.” But the rest of the Republican field, with weaker field operations and later starts, do not have that luxury, said Dave Carney, another New Hampshire Republican consultant and veteran organizer. For those laboring to break out of the pack, Mr. Trump’s absence on July 4 presented a moment to introduce themselves to at least a few voters in person. “Today is about meeting people, right?” Mr. Hurd said. “Not everybody is doom scrolling on social media or consuming cable news.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.032,0.871,0.098,0.9964

They wore red, white and blue outfits, admired the marching band and darted in the street to scoop up hard candy. Their parents, Megan and John, were quietly discussing whether it was safe to even be there. “We had this conversation right before we came,” said Ms. Fantasia, a physician assistant, adding that they had chosen a spot near the beginning of the parade route, reasoning that it was the best place to be if they needed to make a quick exit. “The kids love this kind of stuff,” she said. “We don’t want to miss out on experiences. But is it really worth it?” Americans will gather in packed, public celebrations around the country on Tuesday, in both big cities and small towns, marking the Fourth of July with festivals, Main Street parades and fireworks shows. But as mass shootings have proliferated across the nation in recent years, some people say they have increasingly felt a sense of unease or fear of gun violence overtaking their sense of security at public events that were once considered unquestionably safe, whether concerts, worship services or parades. Others will carry on their holiday celebrations without concern, saying that they consider the possibility of random violence to be remote. But for many, especially in the Chicago area, the fear of gun violence has particular resonance. Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of a mass shooting that took place at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Ill., a suburb 25 miles north of the city. The massacre unfolded as a man climbed onto the roof of a downtown business with a high-powered rifle and fired into the crowd, killing seven people and injuring dozens. Robert E. Crimo III, 22, who faces 117 criminal charges, including murder, has pleaded not guilty. The city of Highland Park is observing the national holiday and anniversary not with a traditional parade, but with a memorial ceremony, community walk, picnic and concert. The city says security will include metal detectors and bag checks. Jacqueline von Edelberg, an artist and activist in Highland Park, said she plans to attend the day’s events, but acknowledged that many people have opted out. “Some people are going in enthusiastic about it because they want to stand in solidarity with people, and other people can’t put themselves in that kind of environment,” Ms. von Edelberg said. Having to consider security risks at public gatherings these days, she said, “is indicative of how normalized gun violence is in America.” As if to underscore the issue as the holiday approached, at least two people died and 28 others were wounded in a shooting at a block party in Baltimore early on Sunday, the police said. A motive for the shooting, which was reported at 12:30 a.m. in Baltimore’s southern neighborhood of Brooklyn, was unclear. In Chicago’s suburbs, police departments have added more officers to protect Fourth of July events. In Evanston, just north of Chicago, city officials announced that there would be an increased presence of police officers, heightened security at intersections along a parade route there, K-9 patrols and drone flights. Other suburbs, including Glencoe, have pledged to add more security and traffic controls during their holiday events. Research shows that Americans view gun violence as a growing threat in their communities, whether they live in rural areas, suburbs or cities. A poll conducted last year by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed widespread fears of armed attackers. About 4 in 10 Americans believe it is at least somewhat likely that they will become a victim of gun violence within the next five years, with young adults the group most likely to report that concern, the survey said. Those fears can be amplified during events that are outdoors and difficult to secure, even with police officers present. “Everybody goes out to crowded public events, even sometimes,” said Jens Ludwig, the director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab. “It’s really striking that this is now a shared feature of the American experience: to worry and hope that some mentally ill person isn’t also there with an AR-15.” In some cases, guns have not been the issue. In 2021, the driver of an S.U.V. plowed through an annual Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wis., killing six people and injuring dozens more. Some people at the parade in Park Ridge, Ill., in May said that they still felt safe in public, or were determined not to let their experience be clouded by worries about security. “I’ve been going to this for 50 years,” said Sue Caldwell, 85, as she walked over to the Memorial Day parade in Park Ridge. “We can’t just give up on everything.” Sharone Marck, a 49-year-old lawyer in Highland Park, is one resident who has decided to avoid the festivities on the Fourth of July. She was at the parade in Highland Park last year. After she heard the staccato pop of gunshots and saw people fleeing, she dropped what she was holding in her hands, grabbed her young son and her mother and helped them sprint away to safety. This year, both of her children will be away at camp. Ms. Marck and her husband are planning to join their neighbors for a cookout, have some drinks and listen to music, away from the center of town, where the shootings took place. “I want to go there to pay my respects, but I don’t want to go with hundreds of people and a huge police presence,” she said.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.138,0.755,0.106,-0.9945
July4th,NYT,2024,Michael C. Bender,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/trump-vp-debate.html?searchResultPosition=18,"Trump Continues to Delay Naming a Running Mate, Amid Biden Debate Fallout","President Biden’s disastrous debate performance has persuaded former President Donald J. Trump to continue to hold off on naming his running mate for now, prompting another round of speculation — including within his own team — about when he may announce his pick. His decision to cede the spotlight to a rival, even temporarily, is a seldom-seen strategy from the attention-driven former president, who has spent a lifetime bending news coverage to his benefit in real estate, on reality television and in national politics. There was no concrete plan for the former president to announce his pick either last week or this week. But Mr. Biden’s fumbling performance left Mr. Trump in the aftermath with little choice but to further linger over his decision, according to two people familiar with the former president’s thinking. Naming a running mate now would risk stepping on the controversy swirling around his opponent, which has included calls from within the Democratic Party and from liberal news media figures for Mr. Biden to step aside. Immediately after the debate, Mr. Trump’s campaign representatives were effectively ignored in Atlanta by reporters, who were more focused on drawing explanations from Mr. Biden’s team. By midmorning the next day, when the Trump campaign has typically fielded a couple dozen media requests (and far more after debates in 2016 and 2020), there was only a handful of inquiries from news reporters. This week, the Fourth of July holiday factors into Mr. Trump’s decision about when to unveil his pick in order to maximize the political — and financial — upswing. As some on the Trump team see it, an announcement this holiday week risks blunting positive news coverage of the pick as many Americans, including some of television’s top news anchors, are on vacation. The former president has, in the past, judged the impact of an announcement based in part on the renown of the television anchor reporting the news. Mr. Trump has also been known to announce decisions on social media or directly to reporters with little or no advance notice to his own team. That has created uncertainty around whom he will choose as his running mate and when he will announce it. “One thing I know for sure is that you can never assume when something is going to happen, because it’s always at Trump’s discretion, and he can decide anytime between now and two weeks to just throw everyone off with a post on social media,” said Erin Perrine, a Republican strategist and former director of press communications for the Trump campaign in 2020. After breaking from former Vice President Mike Pence over a dispute about overturning the 2020 election results, Mr. Trump is said to have narrowed his decision to three top contenders: Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Mr. Trump has claimed to know whom he plans to choose since January, an assertion his aides privately dismissed as rooted more in his instinct for political showmanship than reality. Either way, the former president has about two weeks to share the news with the rest of the world: Campaign aides are planning for Mr. Trump’s running mate to speak from the main stage at the Republican National Convention on July 17. A campaign spokesman said only Mr. Trump knew whom he would pick and when the announcement would be made. Mr. Trump has regularly met with top contenders on his plane, hosted them at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and invited them along on the campaign trail. But advisers to both Mr. Trump and several potential running mates said one thing never directly discussed was the actual job of a vice-presidential nominee. These aides said it was unclear whether Mr. Trump intended to hold formal interviews for the position or, perhaps more likely, inform his final pick in a phone call. Rob Burgess, a Republican strategist who worked on the Trump 2016 and 2020 campaigns, said that an announcement this week would let the former president wrap his pick in the patriotic holiday. “If it was me, I’d be looking for the best way to maximize my media coverage while also energizing the small-dollar donor base,” Mr. Burgess said. “If he did it around the Fourth, he could introduce the ticket as one that will save the Republic and ensure that our grandchildren and your great-grandchildren will continue to have Fourth of July celebrations.” Mr. Trump has no public events this week, a time when he has typically taken breaks in the past. During each of his four years in the White House, he spent part of the Fourth of July holiday playing golf at his club in Sterling, Va. If Mr. Trump keeps his announcement under wraps this week, next week will offer another potential hurdle — or possible opportunity. Mr. Trump had been scheduled to be sentenced for his criminal conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records next Thursday, on July 11. But a delay now seems likely after Mr. Trump’s attorneys asked the judge to postpone after a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, and prosecutors have agreed. If Mr. Trump does not announce his pick next week, that will leave a “big reveal” option for the former president, perhaps even onstage at the convention, under a literal spotlight. Mr. Trump has publicly suggested this option is his preference. But such a move would be a logistical nightmare for his team, which is already coordinating a four-day convention in Milwaukee to accommodate hundreds of Republican delegates and donors and thousands of political journalists. Announcing his pick at the convention would require Mr. Trump to tell a relatively wide group of people about his selection, particularly if he wanted to print signs with both names on the ticket for attendees to wave for the television cameras after the announcement. “It’s not impossible, and it might increase TV ratings for the convention,” Mr. Burgess said. “And President Trump would love that.”",0.187,0.813,0.0,-0.3182,0.046,0.873,0.081,0.9917
July4th,NYT,2024,Esau McCaulley,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/04/opinion/patriotism-july-fourth.html?searchResultPosition=13,Loving America Means Expecting More From It,"Patriotism did not bring my grandfather to the Army recruiter’s office in 1956. Poverty did. A youth spent picking cotton and working odd jobs to help feed his family meant that he was a good way from graduating from high school as his 18th birthday approached. He wanted a better life for himself and saw the Army as a way to make it happen. He ended up staying three years beyond his initial three-year commitment. A sepia-toned photograph of him in his uniform still hangs proudly in his bedroom in Huntsville, Ala. For my grandfather, military life was not without challenges. He recalls that he and other Black soldiers were consistently addressed as “boys” until he stood up to his commanding officer and told him that there were nothing but men in their unit. After this tense and even dangerous exchange, the officer addressed them respectfully — a small triumph that my grandfather never forgot. I asked him why he continued on and he replied, “I guess I loved America more than I thought. I definitely liked it more than Russia.” The military was the first integrated space he encountered. “We served together, marched together, slept in the same barracks and learned to respect each other,” he said. During his six years of service, he finished high school and took extra classes. He returned to civilian life equipped with certifications to be a fireman, a merchant seaman and a bookkeeper. But in Alabama in the 1960s no one would hire him to do any of those things. His first job was as a janitor. My grandfather’s feelings about America are by turns fond and critical. He loved his unit and the moments when the white men he served with treated him as an equal. He also laments those times when he wasn’t, especially in the civilian years that followed. Now, at age 86, he gets animated talking about how he never got to be a fireman. His story embodies America’s great contradiction of being both a land of opportunity and one that hinders it at too many turns. To my children, he is almost a mythic figure who climbed out of American history books. Despite all that he became — he opened his own music store in the 1990s — he cannot help but think he could have been even more. He is my kids’ connection to a past they do not quite understand. My children are not the only ones who do not know what to do with my grandfather’s story or his complex form of patriotism that holds tight to affection despite a deep sense of betrayal. In this country we have come to see patriotism as a positive account of our history that treads lightly upon the nation’s sins. The Fourth of July in particular is a time to wrap ourselves in the flag, grill some meat and run through a playlist of songs with lyrics lauding Americana. Talking about slavery, Jim Crow, economic exploitation and what happened to Black soldiers after they finished their service ruins the vibes. It costs nothing to sing along to “God Bless America.” It requires much more to believe in a place that has failed you. As an African American who speaks on anti-Black racism, I often hear the refrain, “If you hate America so much, you should leave.” But I don’t recount my grandfather’s story because I hate America. I tell it because to omit stories like his would only hinder us from becoming a better country. On the other side of honesty is the possibility of change. For me, telling the truth is the most hopeful form of patriotism. Too often we worry that if we tell our children about our complex and sometimes dark history, their response will be debilitating shame. But instead of lying to our youth, we can give them a task that demands the best of them. We can call upon them to close the often-gaping chasm between our ideals and practices. This is the gift the past offers us, a chance to flee old evils and pursue new goods. It is not enough to imagine ourselves riding down the road with Paul Revere shouting warnings about redcoats or nestled on the boats preparing to storm the beaches of Normandy. We must note that the liberty Revere helped win was for some Americans, not all. We must recognize that the African Americans who risked their lives on that beach in France returned to a racially segregated country in which they were the targets of lynching. This year, my mother’s side of the family will host a reunion on July 4 weekend. We will grill and set off fireworks like everyone else. We might even listen to Marvin Gaye’s or Whitney Houston’s rendition of the national anthem while we wait for the meat to finish cooking. There will also be criticism of this country, especially since it’s an election season. That will not be all we have to say. We’ll talk about the long journey of my family from the plantation to the present freedoms we enjoy. That story contains its own mix of tragedy and triumph. We’ll speak of my grandfather’s service along with that of his father and two of his uncles, all three of which fought in World War II. In my generation, a cousin also served. These emotions of love, pride and regret can reside in the same heart. It is the truest form of patriotism, a love that isn’t complacent, one that demands more than crumbs from justice’s table.",0.0,0.606,0.394,0.5994,0.104,0.76,0.136,0.9881
July4th,NYT,2024,Dan Barry,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/us/politics/democratic-convention-1924.html?searchResultPosition=8,"Divided and Undecided, 2024’s America Rhymes With 1924’s","Things should have been settled. The weary delegates should have already chosen a presidential nominee, packed up their Welcome to New York souvenirs and returned home in time for the nation’s celebration of what it stood for. Instead, the study in indecision that was the Democratic National Convention of 1924 staggered through the Fourth of July weekend, its 3,000 delegates all but ensnared in the red-white-and-blue bunting adorning a tired Manhattan arena slated for demolition. The convention, which lasted 16 days and an astounding 103 ballots, is notorious both for being the longest in history and for being infected by the Ku Klux Klan, which cast a long shadow over the America of that time. Just a few dozen miles to the south, it was celebrating a white-nationalist Independence Day with a hood-and-robe parade right down the Broadway of a beachside New Jersey city. The simultaneous events reflected the divide over what it meant to be an American. Instead of proudly asserting who we are, that distant summer day raised a question being debated over the July Fourth weekend a century later: Who are we? At play were the tensions between the rural and the urban; the isolationist and the world-engaged; the America of white Protestant Christianity and the multiracial America of all faiths; the America that distrusted immigrants and the America that saw itself in those immigrants, and wished to extend a hand. Exploiting these conflicts was the Klan, the post-Civil War white-supremacist organization that had been resurrected a decade earlier. Its “America First” mantra resonated with an aggrieved Protestant middle class — some Republicans, some Democrats — who sensed their power slipping away. Today, in the quickening of a presidential campaign that both parties call a battle for America’s very soul, the historian Jon Meacham hears rhyming between 2024 and 1924, when the country was reeling from war and a pandemic, adapting to a transformative medium — radio — and setting exceedingly restrictive immigration quotas. “Given the demographic and technological changes, the anti-immigrant and racist sentiments, and the anxiety about the loss of a largely white-dominated culture, 1924 has long struck me as an analogous period to our own,” said Mr. Meacham, who has been an informal adviser to President Biden. The thousands of out-of-towners who assembled for the Democratic convention in late June found a Manhattan determined to shed its image in the hustings as Gomorrah on the Hudson. The streets were swept of pickpockets and debris, delegates were greeted with flowers and boutonnieres, and 25,000 city employees staged a welcoming parade led by the silk-hatted mayor, John F. Hylan, who combed his hair at every pause along the Fifth Avenue march. The convention took place just off Madison Square, in the second iteration of Madison Square Garden, a massive Gilded Age confection with a tower topped by a 13-foot copper statue of the goddess Diana. But the dazzling allure of the arena — scene of countless balls and prizefights, flower shows and the scandalous murder of its architect, Stanford White — had dimmed. The convention would be this Garden’s last as a venue of consequence. Still, Diana, as envisioned by the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, continued her vigilance over the metropolis from her heavenly perch, a weather vane turning with the fickle wind. Her thick portfolio included goddess of the crossroads, a fitting responsibility given the stark political choices unfolding beneath her. The two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination to challenge Calvin Coolidge, the Republican incumbent with the mien of an undertaker, almost seemed to represent different parties. One was William Gibbs McAdoo Jr., a tall, well-educated Protestant lawyer from the South. Stage-ready handsome and as stiff as his starched-neck collar, McAdoo was a reform-minded progressive who disdained political machines like New York’s Tammany Hall and supported the prohibition against the manufacture and sale of alcohol. But he was no progressive on matters of race, and as Treasury secretary, he had enforced the policy of his father-in-law, President Woodrow Wilson, to segregate federal agencies. The other, Al Smith, governor of New York, wore his Irish Catholic mutt heritage like a sash, and spoke with a gravelly voice that conjured the multilingual street song of his native Lower East Side. Smith had little formal education and often boasted of being an F.F.M. man, for “Fulton Fish Market.” Still, the work ethic developed at the market served him well as he rose from Tammany Hall functionary to a master negotiator who studied proposed legislation as though cramming for college exams. He favored immigration, opposed Prohibition and was determined to thwart the favorite, McAdoo. The two candidates differed sharply on the nettlesome question of the Klan, whose supporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland weeks earlier had snuffed out a resolution to denounce the organization. (Time magazine nicknamed the gathering the “Kleveland Konvention.”) Smith, who decried the Klan as a threat to democracy, championed a proposed plank in the Democratic Party platform to condemn the Klan by name. McAdoo, though, opposed such specificity and declined to repudiate the Klan, for fear, perhaps, of alienating its admiring delegates and voters. “The Klan influence on that convention was enormous,” said Linda Gordon, a historian and the author of “The Second Coming of the KKK: The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s and the American Political Tradition.” “And, like many social movements, progressive as well as reactionary, they built themselves up through claims of victimization.” The June 20, 1924, issue of the Klan’s newspaper, The Fiery Cross, reflected the ideology coursing through the Democratic convention and the national conversation. Tirades against “Romanistic influences.” Antisemitic riffs. Warnings about miscegenation. A call for “militant, old-fashioned Christianity and operative patriotism.” The intolerance was buffed with a patriotic polish. Amid the odes to the American flag and founding fathers were advertisements catering to nativists. “EAT with Americans at the American Restaurant.” Or purchase a Kluxer’s Knifty Knife, intended “for two-fisted Americans.” Or buy property in the “100 percent American addition” of the Hiawatha Gardens development in Indianapolis. “Lots sold to white Protestant Americans only,” the ad said. “It’s an old story,” said the historian David Levering Lewis, “of a country that is made up of immigrants, but some don’t count because they’re darker, or pro-alcohol, or they’re Catholic or Jewish or otherwise suspect. The great fear was that these people would get on ships and swamp us.” On the first day of the convention, June 24, the delegates streamed into the Garden in Palm Beach suits and summery linen dresses. Women had won the right to vote a few years earlier and were well represented, but there was reportedly only one Black participant — an alternate who would replace a white delegate — in the excited sea lapping against the flag-festooned main platform. Jackets were soon removed, and souvenir fans began to flutter. It was as if the delegates were at the circus, with the rising temperature from bloviation and body heat seeming to summon the animal aromas from the Garden’s big-top spectacle a couple of months earlier. That was how it would be — hot and circuslike — for 16 days. Democrats bickered for nearly a week over the proposed anti-Klan plank, which would have said the party opposed “any effort on the part of the Ku Klux Klan or any organization to interfere with the religious liberty or political freedom of any citizen, or to limit the civic rights of any citizen or body of citizens because of religion, birthplace or racial origin.” But after bruising marathons of backroom bargaining and open-floor confrontations, the plank was defeated by a single vote. Instead, the party tiptoed past any mention of the Klan with language that said, in part: “We insist at all times upon obedience to the orderly processes of the law and deplore and condemn any effort to arouse religious or racial dissension.” In the midst of this debate about the party’s direction, there suddenly appeared on the scene a Civil War veteran named James John Brady, an octogenarian runaway with poor hearing, no teeth and many opinions. Without a word to anyone, Brady had left Mrs. Gray’s boardinghouse in Vincennes, Ind. — in the midst of its own Klan Karnival — and traveled by train to New York City, using savings from his $72 monthly pension. The Travelers Aid Society had generated headlines by taking up his cause to attend the Democratic convention. For a brief day or two, the penniless veteran was the toast of Gotham. Democratic leaders provided him with a convention ticket. An actress from Indiana invited him to her play on Broadway. (“He’s stone deaf and I don’t think he heard a word of the play,” she later said.) Then he was put on a train back home, his ticket covered by his landlady, his brief appearance like a spectral reminder of principles considered long since settled by brother-against-brother bloodshed. Amid bobbing banners, tribal roars and shouted snippets of state anthems, the balloting for a presidential nominee began. In the first round, McAdoo won nearly 40 percent of the vote, well more than Smith’s 22 percent but far from the two-thirds needed to secure the nomination. And so it went, ballot after ballot, through what remained of June and into July, past the scheduled closing indicated in the convention’s official program. The names of dark horses and favorite sons kept popping up, while the contest between the main contenders, McAdoo and Smith — between the rural Klan-adjacent “drys” and the urban Klan-averse “wets” — remained deadlocked. Some delegates up and left the city, depleted of money or patience or both. As for the rest, the humorist Will Rogers jokingly grumbled that New York had invited these delegates to visit, not to live there. The 10th ballot. The 20th. The 40th. The 60th. … Now it was the Fourth of July. The day’s proceedings began with a reading of the Declaration of Independence. Then came the 62nd ballot. The 63rd. The 64th. The 65th. Americans gathered in homes and the street to hear the first convention to be broadcast by radio. The drama gradually veered into farce, as time after time they heard the roll call of state delegations begin with a disembodied Southern voice declaring: “Alabama casts 24 votes for Oscar W. Underwood!” Beyond the convention’s confines, Americans embraced the annual rituals of Independence Day. Baseball fans watched the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Phillies split a doubleheader at the Polo Grounds. Nearly half a million people jammed the beaches of Coney Island. And tens of thousands of Klan members and supporters claimed the Fourth as their own in towns around the country, including the Jersey Shore community of Long Branch. More than 20,000 people wandered the grounds of a Klan-controlled estate just outside the small city. The festivities featured a wedding with bride and groom in hoods; the christening of 16 children; a softball game between New Jersey and Pennsylvania Klan members (who won is lost to time); and speeches, including one by a judge from Indianapolis who reported he had “just come from Jew York.” “No matter what they do, there will not be anybody but a Protestant as a president or vice president,” the judge asserted. According to a report in The New York Times, spectators were also invited to throw baseballs at an effigy of Al Smith, a whiskey bottle in its left hand. Three for a nickel. Then, following the lead of a Klansman on horseback waving an American flag, a few thousand robed Klan members — merchants and businessmen and next-door neighbors, enjoying hooded anonymity — marched through a city by the sea. On one float, a Boy Scout held a sign that said, “We Want The Holy Bible In Our Schools.” On another, labeled “Clean Politics,” a Klansman mimicked casting a ballot under the watchful eye of Lady Justice. Amid cheers and boos and silence, they paraded past the pharmacies and candy stores and luncheonettes, past the signs for movie double features and Hildebrecht’s ice cream, straight down a typical American Broadway. Meanwhile, in a stifling arena close to another Broadway — the one in Manhattan — the deadlock continued. The 66th ballot. The 67th. The 68th. The 69th. The 70th. It took a few more days, but the paralysis — and, perhaps, the fever — eventually broke. On July 9, on the 103rd ballot, a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, a prominent lawyer and diplomat from West Virginia, secured the exhausted party’s nomination after McAdoo and Smith withdrew. Four months later, Davis lost in a landslide to the incumbent, Coolidge. William McAdoo went on to serve as a senator from California. Al Smith won the Democratic nomination in 1928, but lost to the Republican, Herbert Hoover, in another landslide tarnished by pervasive anti-Catholicism. Back in Indiana, James John Brady, the Civil War veteran, recounted his New York adventure to anyone who would listen. “As far as the Ku Klux Klan issue goes,” he would say, “well, the Lord forgive them for they know not what they do.” His words proved prophetic. This second iteration of the Klan — a third would emerge a generation later in violent backlash to the civil rights movement — would continue strong for another couple of years, but its popularity would plummet amid sex scandals, criminal behavior and internecine quarreling. By decade’s end, it would be a shell of a fraternal organization foundering for relevance. Within two years of the disastrous convention of 1924, the grand old Madison Square Garden was a memory, knocked down to make room for an insurance building. But its golden goddess, Diana, found a home at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she continues to keep watch.

Veterans,WSJ,2023,Callum Borchers,https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/your-new-co-worker-is-a-total-drill-sergeant-literally-e4f81fd0,Your New Co-Worker Is a Total Drill Sergeant. Literally.,"Listen up, maggots. What this company needs is more effort and less whining, and I know just the person to set the tone: a drill sergeant or somebody who survived one. So goes the thinking at the companies that are lining up to hire the roughly 200,000 people who leave the military each year. The last jobs report before Veterans Day showed the unemployment rate for former service members is 2.9%, a full point lower than the overall U.S. rate. Businesses’ interest in a Pentagon program that connects service members to companies grew so intense over the summer that the Department of Defense temporarily stopped taking applications from companies to join the ranks of private-sector partners. The SkillBridge program, as it’s known, had 150 participating employers in 2019. Today there are more than 3,800—including Bank of America, Lowe’s and Deloitte—and applications recently reopened, following a review of how to handle the staggering demand. Veterans and companies that recruit from the armed forces say vets’ appeal is rooted in hard work, humility and attention to detail. Many a manager has complained to me that such qualities are hard to find in the age of quiet quitting and coffee badging. The learning curve for former service members in the private sector can be steep, companies say, but they come with little sense of entitlement and can handle—or even crave—constructive criticism. Jenna Ashby MacFarland, a former Army drill sergeant who serves in the Georgia National Guard, joined Wayfair as a recruiter in 2021, a radically different workplace and work persona for her. “You put on your uniform, and it does feel a little bit like having an alter ego, a Clark Kent moment of taking off the glasses,” she says. Recently she took a professional-development course with Wayfair co-workers. “We were talking about being more blunt in your feedback and not tiptoeing around issues, and some folks raised their eyebrows at it. I thought, well, this sounds familiar.” There is a place for a drill sergeant’s directness in the office after all, she thought, though adds that the private-sector use for her background is not barking orders. She’s never told a colleague to drop and give her 50 push-ups. Drill sergeants make good employees, she says, because their high standards can rub off on others. “Wayfair has a strong appetite to hire veterans,” a spokeswoman said, adding that the company employs a few hundred and values their leadership and versatility. A different kind of boot camp My own, unscientific survey of more than 100 ex-drill sergeants’ LinkedIn pages found them in a wide range of roles, including chief operating officer positions at a Massachusetts solar company and a South Carolina Chick-fil-A. Many wind up in law enforcement, of course. Quite a few were in human resources. A handful list their drill-sergeant experience in all-caps in their online profiles. YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THEM YELLING THROUGH THE COMPUTER SCREEN. Sometimes it can be tough to explain how military skills apply to the private sector. A West Point grad, one of the most impressive people I know, once asked me to help translate his résumé for applications to grad school and corporate jobs. I confess that much of it baffled me. He’s still in the Army. Businesses are trying harder to understand now. Meta, for example, created a military-skills translation tool to help match veterans with jobs at the company. Enter your armed-forces title, and it spits out corporate roles that could be a fit. Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, has often hired vets on character and potential, says former Chief Executive David McCormick. Many fit into the firm’s well-known culture of embracing conflict in pursuit of winning ideas. “A significant majority don’t have the necessary skills, but skills are teachable,” says McCormick, a Gulf War veteran who stepped down as CEO last year to run for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. “Ability is not teachable and values are often not teachable, so the qualities that we are least able to influence are the things we often find in veterans.” Microsoft runs what it describes as a tech boot camp for veterans. Almost everyone who completes it—about 3,600 people so far—lands a job internally or at another company, says Chris Cortez, a retired Marine Corps major general who’s now Microsoft’s vice president of military affairs. Plenty of civilians take coding crash courses, too, but people with military experience often bring a different sensibility to their work, says Vishal Amin, a fighter pilot turned cybersecurity leader at Microsoft. “To these veterans this isn’t just a job,” he says. “It’s a way to impact society in a greater capacity.” Willing to pay their dues. Brandon Gillum, who was part of a team that refuels jets on aircraft carriers during his eight-plus years in the Navy, says being hollered at never bothered him. Boot camp was kind of fun, he claims. He’s spent the past six months as an intern learning to be a power plant operator at NRG Energy near Houston and was hired full-time a few weeks ago. Certain abilities carry over. His trained ear, perfected in a cacophony of fuel pumps below deck, can tell when the machinery he now oversees sounds a bit off. Attitude might be his best asset. Gillum says he seeks feedback—no critique rattles him after basic training—and accepts overnight shifts without complaint. The military hierarchy forges a pay-your-dues mindset that differs from some young professionals’ expectation of immediate flexibility. “Anytime I go somewhere and there are more senior people, I do not expect anywhere near the perks that they get,” he says. “I know it took time, and they worked to get to that point. I’m not entitled to it.” Another new NRG plant operator, Air Force veteran Larry Blanco, used to maintain intercontinental ballistic-missile systems. Trading that epic job for intern status while he was training was an adjustment. Then again, there aren’t too many private-sector openings for people who take care of nukes. To those who questioned whether he could learn something new, Blanco crafted a convincing pitch: “If I could be responsible enough to maintain that weapon system, I absolutely can maintain this plant for you.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.038,0.86,0.102,0.9973

The consequences of a war lost through incompetence, delusion and self-defeat will reverberate beyond South Asia. In America, the lack of commitment to win in war, apparent in a humiliating surrender to the Taliban and an ignominious retreat from Kabul, risks eroding trust between servicemen and -women and their civilian and military leaders. If leaders send men and women into battle without dedicating themselves to achieving a worthy outcome, who will step forward to volunteer for military service? Who will offer to endure hardship, take risk and make sacrifices? Winning in Afghanistan meant ensuring that Afghanistan never again became a haven for jihadist terrorists. America and its coalition partners had the means to do so with a low, sustained level of support for Afghans who were bearing the brunt of the fight on a modern-day frontier between barbarism and civilization. But three presidents in a row told the American people that the war in Afghanistan wasn’t worth continued sacrifice. It became typical for citizens to profess support for the troops but not the war. That sentiment was preferable to the derision directed at veterans who fought under difficult conditions in Vietnam. But American warriors won’t long trust a society that doesn’t believe in what the nation is fighting for—as they kill others and risk their own lives. Winning in war also means convincing the enemy that he is defeated. America’s quick-fix approach to Afghanistan, with persistent promises of imminent withdrawal, made the war longer and more expensive than it needed to be. It weakened Afghan allies; it strengthened the Taliban, their terrorist allies and their Pakistani sponsors. Winning in war also requires consolidating military gains to achieve an enduring political outcome. In Afghanistan this meant an Afghan government hostile to jihadist terrorists, with security forces capable of withstanding the regenerative capacity of the Taliban. But the Obama and Trump administrations stopped actively targeting the Taliban, gave the enemy a timeline for U.S. withdrawal, and then pursued a negotiated settlement. To rationalize their ambivalence about the outcome of the war, civilian leaders and even some generals used terms like “responsible end” as a substitute for victory. Many leaders simply didn’t show the same determination to win as the warriors they sent into combat. The long war against jihadist terrorist organizations isn’t over; it is entering a new, more dangerous phase. America’s rivals—including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran—are emboldened. They are watching a Defense Department that seems to focus more on climate change than being prepared to fight, one that promotes postmodernist theories that undermine the warrior ethos and valorize victimhood. Our leaders have an obligation to protect the warrior ethos and build America’s military capabilities, rather than promote destructive philosophies and attempt to solve problems better handled by other departments. On Veterans Day, we should thank the men and women who served in Afghanistan and the families who gave their last full measure of devotion. We should assure them that America’s war in Afghanistan was a just response to the most devastating terrorist attack in history. As President George W. Bush observed on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, “You have shielded your fellow citizens from danger. You have defended the beliefs of your country and advanced the rights of the downtrodden. You have been the face of hope and mercy in dark places. You have been a force for good in the world. Nothing that has followed—nothing—can tarnish your honor or diminish your accomplishments. To you and the honored dead, our country is forever grateful.” But we might also ask American veterans to serve again on the day designated to honor them. Veterans are best equipped to explain to those on active duty that they are part of a living historical community that is proud of them for volunteering to serve at a critical time. Veterans might tell young warriors that we need them to remain ready to fight because wars don’t end when one party disengages. And we might ask veterans to explain to those considering military service the intangible rewards, especially being part of an endeavor larger than themselves and working on a team that takes on the qualities of a family. America needs our best young men and women to volunteer to serve in the armed forces—even more after our withdrawal from one theater in a war that continues.",0.231,0.355,0.414,0.4767,0.21,0.625,0.165,-0.9954
Veterans,WSJ,2021,Daniel Gade,https://www.wsj.com/articles/our-veterans-need-help-becoming-civilians-again-11636632001,Veterans Need Help Becoming Civilians Again,"Our treatment of troops returning from combat has led to a culture of permanent disability. They deserve better. As we pay tribute every November to those who serve and have served, I always think of Dennis Miller of La Salle, Michigan. Dennis gave the ultimate sacrifice during a firefight in Ramadi, Iraq, on November 10, 2004. His parents were notified of his death the next day—on Veterans Day. I was his company commander, bearing ultimate responsibility for his death. I was wounded but survived with minimal harm. I was less lucky two months later, when a roadside IED detonated and ripped through my lower body. I was evacuated by a Marine Corps helicopter and operated on at a Navy surgical facility. Some 25 sailors and Marines gave their blood to save my life. After getting flown back to the U.S., I lay unconscious at Walter Reed Hospital for three weeks, then stayed in the intensive care unit for three months. I had more than 40 surgeries during that time, including the amputation of my right leg at the hip. My path to recovery was long and challenging, but with the support of family and close friends I was able to find my place in the world again. I stayed in the Army and went on to graduate school, eventually earning a master’s degree and Ph.D. in public policy. I taught at West Point for six years and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. I recovered and thrived. Far too often, however, veterans returning to the civilian world are diverted from paths of self-sufficiency and shuffled down paths of dependency and dysfunction. I witnessed this personally at Walter Reed. Soldiers were transformed from men and women of consequence—bravely fighting for their country—to wards of the state, dependent on others and on charity for their sustenance, purpose and meaning. One soldier whom I knew had been wounded in 2003 and was fully able to function by 2005—yet lingered on at the hospital until at least 2009. His identity had become “patient,” and his goals had been foreclosed. Later, as I took on various roles in government, I observed these contortions professionally. While working as an adviser to the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs on disability compensation from 2008 to 2013, I was privy to backroom conversations acknowledging that the system was a “one-way ratchet”: Only higher payments and increased disability ratings were to be recommended. Too often missing from the discussion was any idea of helping these veterans rehabilitate themselves, with more training, counseling and employment aimed at overcoming disabilities. Between 2000 and 2020, the number of veterans receiving disability benefits nearly doubled to 5.5 million; those with the most severe categories of impairment, rated at 70% disability or more, increased nearly sevenfold to 2.2 million. Meanwhile, the overall veteran population fell by about a third to 18.5 million. Today, a larger proportion of veterans is compensated for disabilities than ever before in the VA’s history. The decadeslong rise, former VA Secretary James Peake explained to me in a 2017 interview, “has been facilitated because that’s what the laws and the rules are.” A recent Iraq war vet told me: “Essentially what happens a lot of the time now” is that the VA “shoves the benefits down the veteran’s throat.” I retired from the Army after 25 years of service in May 2017. The next day, I realized to my horror that I was waiting for my phone to ring. For my whole life I had been the leader, the problem-solver, the “answer man.” All of a sudden, I realized I wasn’t that man anymore. Nobody needed me. Nobody was going to call. That psychological transition was the most painful and difficult period of my life. As surprising as it may be for my civilian friends to hear, there is a part of me that misses combat. Every day that I served, I had a sense of utter clarity and purpose. I knew exactly what I was doing, and I knew that there were people counting on me to do it. The civilian world pales in comparison. Every person who enlists in the military will eventually leave the service, a turning point that is sure to have profound effects on the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, millions of those veterans are being folded into a VA model of permanent disability, which reflects a flawed understanding of human nature and an outdated view of current medical capabilities. Since 2014, the VA’s budget for disability benefits has eclipsed its spending on healthcare. As a society, we are now paying more for veterans to be sick than for veterans to get better. Though combat injuries comprise just a tiny fraction of all VA-diagnosed disabilities, the number of compensation recipients has continued to soar. Last year alone, nearly 260,000 veterans began receiving disability benefits—about five times the number of American troops wounded in the Afghan and Iraq wars since 2001. The idea that veterans by definition are “disabled” has become a story the country is too eager to accept. Before new recruits enter military service, they generally have been useful plows in the peacetime world. We break them down in combat training and build them back up through drills and commands, forging them into swords (to complete the metaphor from the Book of Isaiah). But once their service is complete, we don’t put enough effort into converting them back into plows. We leave veterans as swords and frequently discard them. We shower them with superficial celebrations even as we treat them with neglect, and these swords pick up rust. Fundamental reform of the VA’s disability compensation system is crucial to ensure that veterans can lead lives of meaning, purpose and value. The first priority is to establish employment as the ultimate goal of the transition process, including for veterans with work-limiting conditions. Meaningful employment should be the core objective, with the goal of allowing a veteran to leave behind temporary financial assistance. We must also reassess the term “disability,” limiting its application to truly disabling conditions and providing more funding for veterans in that circumstance. Money saved by these stricter requirements could be used, in turn, to pay for more job training, more counseling services and even cash incentives for veterans making the transition back to civilian life. These changes will not be easy to achieve. Powerful interest groups stand in their way, and politicians often lack the will and courage to engage with these thorny issues. But what we are doing now for veterans plainly isn’t working, as the rising rate of veteran suicide rate suggests. This Veterans Day, I am honoring the memory of Dennis Miller. I am also reflecting on the millions of veterans who have served with honor and bravery. Our goal should be to help them return to civilian life and succeed in their communities, just as they once succeeded in uniform. The country should commit itself to helping them become useful plows again—not mourn the fact that they are no longer swords ready for battle.",0.0,0.649,0.351,0.4019,0.087,0.788,0.125,0.9944
Veterans,WSJ,2020,H.R. McMaster,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ponder-the-rewards-of-military-service-11605049025,Ponder the Rewards of Military Service,"Civilians don’t always understand what compels warriors to sacrifice and endure. Fewer and fewer Americans are connected to the country’s all-volunteer professional military. The military’s separation from society is consequential. In a democracy, if citizens don’t understand the military, they won’t support the policies and investments necessary to secure the nation. Veterans Day is an opportunity to consider what compels servicemen and -women to act courageously, endure hardships, take risks and make sacrifices. For many Americans it is easy to imagine the hardships associated with military service, such as long separations from family or arduous conditions. It is more difficult to understand the less tangible rewards of service. One reward of service is being part of a community that sustains itself through an ethos that binds warriors to one another. That covenant is based on honor, duty, courage, loyalty and self-sacrifice. An effective military unit takes on the qualities of a family, in which the man or woman next to you is willing to give everything, even his or her own life, for you. Many veterans miss that military family when they rejoin civilian life. As the psychiatrist and author Jonathan Shay has noted, “what a returning soldier needs most when leaving war” is “a living community to whom his experience matters.” Another reward of service is a veteran’s pride in having exhibited courage and compassion. American veterans are both warriors and humanitarians because they engage against enemies that are a threat to all civilized peoples. Older veterans defeated Nazi fascism, Japanese imperialism and communist totalitarianism. Since the most devastating terrorist attack in history on Sept. 11, 2001, America’s younger veterans have been engaged against enemies who use a perverted interpretation of religion to promote hatred and violence against innocents. Veterans Day is a chance to express gratitude for the sacrifices American warriors make, but it is also an opportunity to welcome veterans into our communities and encourage them to join organizations such as nonprofits Spirit of America or Team Rubicon that bring them together with each other and their fellow citizens. A more complete view of the rewards of service might help attract young volunteers to the armed forces. America’s veterans have served on teams committed to excellence in which bigotry, racism and other forms of intolerance and prejudice have no place. Veterans want their fellow citizens to be bound through a sense of common purpose, mutual respect and willingness to sacrifice. Perhaps pondering the rewards of service could help Americans transcend political and social differences, regain confidence in our national character and restore pride in the republic that veterans fought to preserve.",0.0,0.617,0.383,0.4767,0.091,0.711,0.199,0.9939

Mr. Trump spent the last two weeks tweeting insults at the Democratic leaders of the state and city he has long called home, starting when the president said he would relocate to the Sunshine State because he has been “treated very badly” by political leaders. “Good riddance,” Mr. Cuomo told reporters the next day. The governor at first said that the president didn’t pay any local taxes, then when pushed about how he knew that, said he was speculating. He said he believed Mr. Trump was leaving because Manhattan prosecutors are trying to subpoena copies of Mr. Trump’s tax returns. The president’s lawyers are challenging the subpoena in court. The president then tweeted about the state’s tax climate, scrutiny from prosecutors (which he pinned on Mr. Cuomo) and the coming release of hundreds of prisoners awaiting trial as a result of changes to New York’s bail requirements. The governor dismissed the president’s grumbling as “deflections” and said he has lowered state taxes. Mr. de Blasio has been a consistent critic of Mr. Trump, and ridiculed him as “Con Don” during his abortive attempt to win the Democratic nomination for president. Mr. Cuomo hasn’t; he met with Mr. Trump between his election and inauguration, and for a year avoided criticizing him by name. “I went out of my way numerous times to attempt to work with President Trump,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday, speaking to reporters on a highway overpass. “You know what New York got back from Trump? Nothing, nada, goose egg.” Whatever their frustrations, Messrs. Cuomo and de Blasio said the Veterans Day parade shouldn’t be politicized. The best chance of that happening is if the men don’t talk. TISH’S PAYMENTS: New York state Attorney General Letitia James’s campaign committee directed more than $36,000 to a Brooklyn hairstylist and brand manager during and after her successful election bid last year, campaign-finance filings show. Ms. James, a Democrat, made the campaign payments to Iyesata Marsh starting in May of last year and ending this February. The campaign paid $22,000 to use Ms. Marsh’s Brooklyn studio as a campaign office for the last four months of the campaign. A spokeswoman for the James campaign said that the payments to Ms. Marsh were for professional campaign services, and that she worked as an event manager. In an interview, Ms. Marsh said she never styled Ms. James’s hair but declined to provide specific details on what she did. ON THE AIR FOR ROADS: A coalition led by state contracting groups has shifted its pitch for more road funding to focus on urban needs in a pair of advertisements set to hit the airwaves this week. The ad campaign by Rebuild NY Now comes as state lawmakers consider the next five-year capital plan from the New York State Department of Transportation. Usually, upstate legislators would use the DOT capital plan for leverage as downstate lawmakers pushed for a new capital plan for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “Critical infrastructure in urban communities is in even worse shape,” says one video, which is part of a six-figure radio, television and digital-advertising effort set to launch Tuesday. The strategy change reflects the new balance of power in Albany: Democrats from downstate areas control both the state Assembly and Senate. In the state Senate, the upstate Democrats represent urban areas—including Sen. Tim Kennedy, a Democrat from Buffalo who chairs the chamber’s transportation committee.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.049,0.91,0.042,-0.5661
Veterans,WSJ,2019,Rob Henderson,https://www.wsj.com/articles/cold-welcome-for-veterans-on-campus-11573411754,Cold Welcome for Veterans on Campus,"‘But don’t you ever feel like a sucker for serving?” A fellow military veteran asked me this question a couple of years ago, when I was a senior at Yale. Like me, he had recently completed his service and was studying at a top university. He said he was mystified, observing that the predominantly working- and middle-class people in the military swear an oath to defend with their lives the U.S. Constitution, including the First and Second amendments. Meanwhile, affluent college students regularly trash the First and seek to dismantle the Second. Are veterans being duped, he questioned, into believing they are upholding American values while the richest kids in the world—the ones being groomed for success and power—try to undermine them? He’s not the only one who feels that way. Many veterans I know who enter college are bewildered by what they see: students from the top income decile expressing derision for the values that service members signed up to defend. Perhaps they could be forgiven for feeling like suckers. Seeing our peers question the Constitution isn’t the only jarring experience for veterans. For many, the treatment of race on campus is a major culture shock. The military is perhaps the most meritocratic institution in the U.S. Women and men of all backgrounds come together, united in their purpose to defend this great country. The best research we have shows that women and nonwhite service members report greater job satisfaction and quality of life than do white male members. Arbitrary physical features like race and sex were treated as inconsequential because we were evaluated primarily on rank and performance. In college, however, there are clear social incentives to disparage people for their race. I recall being stunned when one student, with a gleeful expression, bellowed to a classmate, “F— your white tears!” Other students around her snapped their fingers to express approval. One’s sex is fair game, too. For veterans trying to integrate on campus, insulting men signals coalitional solidarity with those who adhere to the dominant campus ideology. This works even, perhaps especially, if you are a white man. The intent behind the insult matters. In the military, we exchanged insults often. It’s a form of social bonding, a way to strengthen relationships with the target of the insult. It helps to bring us together. College students also insult each other to bond socially—but not with the targets of the insults. They wish to impress the onlookers. They’re looking for bystanders to snap their fingers or share their social-media posts. The purpose is to vilify a transgressor in order to bond with observers. It’s effective. Veterans who first serve in the military and then attend elite colleges learn to navigate both moral worlds. On campus we learn to blend in, even at the cost of feeling betrayed. We keep our love for America to ourselves. We don’t want to give veterans a bad reputation. We want to make friends. We try to understand campus protesters, to see where they’re coming from. Maybe their grievances are a bit overblown, but still, they’re young. They’re still maturing. Just like we were when we volunteered our lives for this country. Just like our friend was when he hanged himself after returning from his second deployment. In truth, many of the rich kids at elite colleges love American values, too. But they know that loving the Constitution and its first two amendments marks one as working-class or low-status, and that being against those things codes as educated. So they rail against those values to distinguish themselves from one crowd and fit into another. This Veterans Day we can reflect on the sacrifices made by those who volunteered to defend the United States. But let’s also find time to consider that these sacrifices were undertaken to defend values that our ruling-class-in-waiting seeks to undermine. Many students at elite colleges are duping themselves, too. They don’t realize that they are protected by the very principles they despise and the people to whom they condescend.

Shear,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/biden-veterans-day.html?searchResultPosition=4,Biden Honors Veterans in Ceremony at Arlington Cemeter,"President Biden urged Americans to take a moment to honor those who serve in the military and their families on Monday, using the backdrop of Arlington National Cemetery to observe Veterans Day one last time as the country’s commander in chief. “The world is dependent on each of you and all of us, all of you, to keep honoring the women and the men and the families who have borne the battle,” Mr. Biden said. “To keep protecting everything they fought for, to keep striving to heal our nation’s wounds, to keep perfecting our union.” Mr. Biden’s remarks came after he placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. The president has presided over the armed forces during a tumultuous four years. He has said one of the worst moments of his term was the deaths of 13 service members in Afghanistan in 2021 after Mr. Biden ordered the withdrawal of all American troops from the country. Service members have also been assigned to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russia and to the Middle East after attacks against Israel led by Hamas that killed 1,200 people. But Mr. Biden has not ordered large deployments of troops in either place. In his remarks, the president recalled traveling to the battlefields where American soldiers had fought, including his visit earlier this year to the cliffs in Normandy, France, above the beaches where troops began their offensive to defeat Nazi Germany during World War II. “Just standing there, you wonder, ‘How in God’s name did they have the courage to do what they did?’” Mr. Biden said. As president, Mr. Biden spent considerable effort trying to increase benefits and services for veterans and their families. He helped push through the PACT Act, which provides care for veterans who suffered the consequences of toxic fumes from so-called burn pits while deployed overseas. The president also directed his administration to speed up the delivery of benefits, expand access to doctors and confront high rates of suicide among veterans. Jill Biden, the first lady, spent much of the past four years focused on helping military families economically. Mr. Biden has often said his efforts on behalf of veterans were driven in part by the death of his son Beau, who was a major in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps. His unit was deployed to Iraq in 2008, while Mr. Biden was running for vice president, and he later developed cancer and died in 2015. The president has said he believes that his son developed his cancer as a result of serving next to football-field-sized pits of trash, jet fuel and tires that were burned by the military. The toxic fumes often settled over troops who, like Beau Biden, were stationed nearby. “I still remember the day he asked me to pin his bars on him,” the president told the audience of veterans and military families at the cemetery. “He stood ramrod straight — how proud Jill and I, our entire family felt, like so many of you.” It was largely because of his grief over his son’s death, Mr. Biden has said, that he did not run for president in 2016. People close to him have said he now regrets that decision because Donald J. Trump won that election. Now, with Mr. Trump elected to a second term, some of Mr. Biden’s policies with regard to veterans and the military may be reversed. In his remarks on Monday, the president did not refer to Mr. Trump, but he made clear how important he thinks it is to continue to support the men and women who serve the country. “This is the last time I will stand here at Arlington as commander in chief,” he said. “It’s been the greatest honor of my life, to lead you, to serve you, to care for you, to defend you, just as you defended us generation after generation after generation.”",0.0,0.68,0.32,0.5106,0.105,0.793,0.101,-0.7227
Veterans,NYT,2024,Doug Haller,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5913435/2024/11/10/arizona-cardinals-pat-tillman-veterans-day/?searchResultPosition=32,"Ahead of Veterans Day, Arizona Cardinals fans honor Pat Tillman’s spirit","GLENDALE, Ariz. — Before he left home, Rodney Selsor grabbed the framed red No. 40 jersey that he’s kept displayed on the wall of his living room, not far from the television. A lifelong Arizona Cardinals fan, Selsor had never worn the jersey to a game. With Veterans Day approaching, Sunday was different. Before Arizona’s 31-6 win over the New York Jets, Selsor walked with 8-year-old daughter Selena into Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza outside of State Farm Stadium. It was a postcard day in the desert, 75 degrees, blue skies. A recorded voice instructed fans how to enter the stadium. A couple of Jets fans chanted “Aa-ron Rod-gers!” around the corner. Wearing the Tillman jersey, Selsor stationed Selena near a sculpture of Tillman, which had 112 red roses (four rows of 28) displayed on a wall behind it, and took her photo. His reasoning: “Because I want to teach her about the history of this man and what he did for this country,” said Selsor, who considers Tillman an American hero. NFL game days are unique. On the field, the competition and violence are unmatched. Off it, fans rep jerseys from yesteryear, the past meeting the present, a fashion statement of respect. At Solider Field in Chicago, the 34 of Walter Payton and 54 of Brian Urlacher rule. At Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, the 18 of Peyton Manning dominates. In Kansas City, the 58 of Derrick Thomas is popular. In Washington, it’s Sean Taylor and jersey No. 21. Here, Larry Fitzgerald’s 11 has a strong presence, but it’s Tillman’s 40 that grabs attention. For many, the jersey represents something beyond football. It’s a spirit. A symbol of something greater. Tillman’s story is well known. How he walked away from pro football to join the U.S. Army in the wake of the 2001 terror attacks. How he died from friendly fire. How military officials hid the truth from his family. Last week, ESPN aired an E60 special that featured new reporting and details from Tillman’s story. Twenty years after his death, the former strong safety’s sacrifice continues to move people. Nowhere more than Arizona. Joe and Lucy Gutierrez sat in Section 118 at State Farm Stadium on Sunday. Joe wore a “Salute to Service” Tillman jersey, while Lucy wore a red Tillman jersey. Joe had grown up a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. By the time they moved here from Albuquerque in 2008, “we had already lost him,” he said, referring to Tillman. The couple caught up quickly. A seventh-round draft pick out of Arizona State, Tillman played for the Cardinals from 1998 to 2001. As a rookie, he started 10 games and participated on special teams. In 2000, Tillman posted 155 tackles and forced two fumbles, but the Cardinals finished 3-13. The St. Louis Rams that offseason offered Tillman a five-year contract worth $9 million, but Tillman felt loyal to coach Dave McGinnis. He signed a one-year deal with the Cardinals worth a reported $512,000. Tillman wasn’t the Cardinals’ best player, but he was among the most popular. Before the 2001 season, quarterback Jake Plummer — who also played with Tillman at Arizona State — told reporters that he wasn’t the biggest name on the team anymore. Tillman was. Tillman missed four games in his final season because of an ankle injury. He played through pain, but the Cardinals were better. Entering the regular season’s final week, they had a chance to post their first non-losing record in three seasons. On a cold and wet day at FedEx Field, the Cardinals jumped to a 17-6 lead over Washington, but they couldn’t hold on, losing 20-17. On the game’s final play, Tillman, who had nine tackles, approached the line of scrimmage, his breath visible through his facemask. As Washington quarterback Kent Graham took a knee, ending the game, Tillman raised his arms and walked off a football field for the final time. “Losing stinks in general, but losing like this is brutal,” he told reporters after the game. Six months later, Tillman informed the Cardinals that he was joining the U.S. Army, along with his younger brother Kevin. The initial plan was for Tillman to take a three-year leave of absence. On Sunday, Rich and Kelly Palmer walked into the Tillman plaza. Having attended games at every MLB stadium, the Vermont couple had started visiting NFL and NHL venues. Rich wore a throwback Joe Namath jersey, and Kelly wore a green Jets T-shirt. That morning, son Matt had texted them and told them to make sure to check out the Tillman statue. “We’ve been football fans our whole life,” Kelly said. “To think he gave up his career, fought for our country, lost his life for our country, that speaks volumes about him as a person. And he was like that on the field as well as off the field.” More people arrived. After admiring the statue, one woman approached and gave Tillman a fist bump. Angelo Saenz, wearing a white Tillman jersey he had purchased eight months ago, took a photo of his son Alex. Even Gene Lower, the photographer who had taken the photo that inspired the Tillman sculpture, helmet off, hair flying, posed for a photo. Rich Cralley said he looks forward to this game all season. Veterans Day weekend. The roses behind Tillman. A Cardinals season-ticket holder for 25 years, Cralley recalled meeting Tillman during training camp in Flagstaff one year, and how Tillman had stayed after practice to sign autographs, treating everyone as a friend. Wearing a black Tillman jersey, Cralley wondered if fans across the country realized how much Tillman means to Arizona and the country. What he stood for. How he carried himself. Standing in the plaza, Cralley sent photos of the statue to friends and a nephew in Minnesota. “I don’t want him to be forgotten,” he said. “He’s special, and I hope he always will be.”",0.0,0.647,0.353,0.5994,0.062,0.808,0.13,0.997
Veterans,NYT,2023,Michael Gold,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-new-hampshire-veterans.html?searchResultPosition=43,"In Veterans Day Speech, Trump Promises to ‘Root Out’ the Left","Former President Donald J. Trump, on a day set aside to celebrate those who have defended the United States in uniform, promised to honor veterans in part by assailing what he portrayed as America’s greatest foe: the political left. Using incendiary and dehumanizing language to refer to his opponents, Mr. Trump vowed to “root out” what he called “the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.” “The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous and grave than the threat from within,” Mr. Trump said Saturday in a nearly two-hour Veterans Day address in Claremont, N.H. Mr. Trump accused Democrats and President Biden of trying to roll back his efforts to expand veteran access to health care, causing soaring inflation, pushing the country to the brink of World War III, endangering the troops in Afghanistan and of lying and rigging elections. He also promised to care for America’s veterans, reviving a hyperbolic claim that he made throughout his 2016 campaign that Democrats “treat the illegal aliens just pouring into our country better than they treat our veterans.” And he said he would divert money currently earmarked “for the shelter and transport of illegal aliens” to instead provide shelter and treatment for homeless military veterans. Here are some of the more notable elements of Mr. Trump’s Veterans Day speech. Courtroom Cameras. Mr. Trump, who is facing a civil fraud trial in New York and four criminal indictments, said in a radio interview earlier this week that he would welcome cameras in the courtroom. He went further on Saturday. “I want this trial to be seen by everybody in the world,” Mr. Trump said to a cheering crowd, referring to his federal election trial in Washington. “The prosecution wishes to continue this travesty in darkness, and I want sunlight.” Mr. Trump, who has denounced the prosecutions he faces as politically motivated and accused Mr. Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department, said that he was convinced Americans who watched the trial would reach his view. “Every person in America and beyond should have the opportunity to study this case firsthand,” he said. Mr. Trump’s remarks came the day after his lawyers in the case filed papers arguing those proceedings should be televised, backing a similar push by other media organizations. It was a rare instance in which the former president found common ground with the mainstream media, which Mr. Trump attacked repeatedly on Saturday. Hands Raised. As he has before, Mr. Trump again called for executing drug dealers, praising China for making drug trafficking a capital offense. But in New Hampshire, a state where the opioid crisis has hit particularly hard, he turned to an informal straw poll to strengthen his case. “Let’s have a vote,” Mr. Trump said to the crowd. “Who would be in favor of the death penalty — now, wait, don’t go yet — knowing that it will solve the problem?” A majority of the crowd raised their hands. Fewer hands went up when Mr. Trump asked who would oppose such a move. When one woman raised her hand emphatically, Mr. Trump looked at her with a small smile and asked, “Are you a liberal?” She wildly shook her head to the contrary. Facts Flouted. Mr. Trump also repeated lies, falsehoods, exaggerations and half-truths that he has told routinely on a number of subjects, including on gas prices, U.S. energy independence, election fraud and the 2020 elections. Facts Flouted. Mr. Trump also repeated lies, falsehoods, exaggerations and half-truths that he has told routinely on a number of subjects, including on gas prices, U.S. energy independence, election fraud and the 2020 elections. Mr. Trump also derided Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican who has said Mr. Trump cannot win next year; Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former House speaker; Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent; and Mr. Biden. Compliments Given. Mr. Trump lauded Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. “There’s a guy I’d like to make my defense chief,” he said. “I wouldn’t call him my defense chief, I’d call him my offense chief.” And he complimented President Xi Jinping of China, of whom he said, “He’s like Central Casting. There’s nobody in Hollywood that can play the role of President Xi — the look, the strength, the voice.”",0.0,0.794,0.206,0.3818,0.114,0.766,0.12,-0.6607
Veterans,NYT,2022,Peter Coy,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/opinion/veterans-recruitment-race.html,It’s Veterans Day. Where Have All the Veterans Gone?,"With each passing Veterans Day, there are fewer veterans in America for other Americans to thank. The number of living Americans who had served in the military fell to 16.5 million last year from 26.4 million in 2000, according to the Census Bureau. This shrinkage is good in one important respect — it’s a sign that the United States, while not fully at peace, has needed fewer troops in recent decades than in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The current number of active-duty troops, at 1.4 million, is little more than a tenth of the peak of 12.1 million in 1945. But it’s a problem, too. The military still needs troops in this dangerous world, and recruiting suffers when there are fewer veterans to serve as role models and storytellers. “The grandpas, uncles, aunts who served just have an extraordinary influence,” Thomas Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general who is the director of the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation, told me this week. “You may not think it’s a big deal, but it plants a seed in young people. It helps with recruiting.” This Veterans Day I want to write about why young people do and don’t join the all-volunteer armed forces and what the services can do to reach their recruitment goals. As The Times reported this year, the recruiting deficit “is on pace to be worse than any since just after the Vietnam War. It threatens to throw a wrench into the military’s machinery, leaving critical jobs unfilled and some platoons with too few people to function.” People join the armed forces to defend their country, to share esprit de corps, to continue a family tradition, to see the world, to learn a trade or to land a stable job with reasonable pay and generous benefits. Those who don’t join the armed forces might fear getting hurt or killed, or dislike the military, or think they have better career options in civilian life. New research published in this month’s issue of The Quarterly Journal of Economics could help young people and their families decide whether the military, or at least the Army, is right for them. (The article is behind a paywall; an earlier draft that’s nearly identical is here.) The researchers found that race matters: In the long run, while enlisting in the Army is roughly neutral for white people economically, it is significantly positive for Black people. “Army Service in the All-Volunteer Era,” as the study is titled, finds that Black people who enlist earn $5,500 to $15,000 more per year 11 to 19 years after applying than otherwise similar Black people who don’t enlist, while white service members “do not experience significant changes.” Enlisting also boosts homeownership and marriage rates for Black people. A possible explanation for the racial differential is that Black applicants tend to have worse alternative opportunities. For example, the research shows they tend to come from families with lower incomes and from counties with worse economic conditions than white applicants, so they have more to gain from military experience. Citing previous studies, they say it may be that Army service provides Black soldiers with human capital, access to networks and “credentialing effects that diminish racial discrimination.” For the overall applicant pool, moving beyond pay, Army service increases disability compensation by around $3,000 per year, mostly for partial disability payments available only to veterans, but it’s impossible to know how much of that is because they’re more disabled versus better compensated for their disabilities. Army service has a small to insignificant effect on full disability and no effect on mortality 11 to 19 years out, the study finds. Homeless veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder are the sad exception, not the rule. That’s good news, because it undermines the narrative that serving in the military is outright bad for people economically, physically and mentally. The five economists who wrote the paper include two from the U.S. Military Academy, Matthew Gudgeon and Lt. Col. Kyle Greenberg, as well as two from the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis, Adam Isen and Corbin Miller, along with Richard Patterson of Brigham Young University. The work wasn’t sponsored by the Army or the Treasury and doesn’t necessarily represent their official positions. As an aside, there’s a Nobel connection to the research. West Point’s Greenberg was a doctoral student of Joshua Angrist, who shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences last year for work on teasing out causation. In one landmark study that was explained by the Nobel committee, Angrist used a natural source of randomness — a person’s draft number — to estimate the effects of compulsory military service. This paragraph is a bit wonky, so feel free to skip ahead. The authors of the new paper exploited a different source of variability, namely the initial score on the Armed Forces Qualification Test that all applicants must take, to estimate the effects of voluntary service. The Army has two thresholds for scores, 31 and 50. Scores below 31 are ordinarily disqualifying; scores below 50 ordinarily don’t entitle applicants to a signing bonus. So people who score at or just above each of those thresholds are more likely to become soldiers than those who score just below them. The people clustered around the thresholds were the focus of the study. If those who scored just above the thresholds did better later in life, it can be inferred that military service was the reason, since they were otherwise indistinguishable from applicants whose scores were just a tad below the cutoffs. Angrist says the methodology was smart and well executed. “This is the best paper on this topic in decades, maybe ever,” he told me. Back to the question of how the military can meet its recruiting goals. Quotas are harder to fill at times like the present, when the unemployment rate is low and civilian employers are bidding up wages. Similarly, efforts to expand child care and free community college for the general public make the military’s programs look less special. One (expensive) solution, then, is to raise pay and signing bonuses — which already range up to $50,000 — and further improve benefits. The armed forces could make recruiting a lot easier by lowering standards for physical and mental fitness — many potential recruits are disqualified by low test scores, obesity or drug abuse — but that could damage the military over the long run. A more positive approach, said Spoehr, would be to “reacquaint the American people with the military.” There are still communities, particularly in the South, where serving in the military is a revered tradition. But Spoehr said more and more young people who don’t know any veterans personally are getting distorted impressions from movies, which portray members of the armed services as either superheroes or losers. That brings us back to Veterans Day. Thank the veterans you know. There’s a lot they can still teach us.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.105,0.765,0.13,0.9767

The museum put advertisements in local newspapers, postings on social media and notices on veterans’ hall bulletin boards. Museum officials figured they would hear from someone. Just under 50,000 Sherman tanks were manufactured, and considering that each tank had a crew of five, hundreds of thousands of G.I.s were trained to drive them or fire the guns. But no one answered the museum’s ads. The museum was well aware that the roll call from World War II — soldiers and sailors now in their 90s, or older — is growing shorter every year. Of the 16.5 million Americans who served in World War II, just under 99 percent have died, according to the National World War II Museum. The museum had all but given up when a museum volunteer went to a diner less than three miles from the museum. He noticed, behind the cash register as he paid the check, a black-and-white photograph of a soldier standing next to a Sherman tank. There was a name under the photograph: Julius Fiorini. The museum tracked down Fiorini, now 99, and decided to get a jump on Veterans Day with a ceremony on Thursday that he attended. Fiorini was part of a tank crew that drove across France after D-Day. His son Tom, 71, said his father had received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. He did not talk much about the war, his family said. His grandson Thomas Jr. wrote in a reminiscence that he had not known about the Bronze Star until his grandfather took out his medals recently and put them on the wall, something he had never done before. Occasionally Fiorini talked about pulling his lieutenant from the burning wreckage of his tank during a firefight. Another story was about a bullet that struck his hand while Fiorini was standing next to the tank. “The bullet, I think it went through his hand and was stuck in the side of the tank,” Tom Fiorini said. It did not stop Julius Fiorini from returning to the job he had held before he joined the Army, as a butcher at a supermarket warehouse in the Bronx. Thomas Jr. wrote in the reminiscence that when he asked the what-was-it-like questions that children put to grandparents, Fiorini’s only reply was, “War is hell, kid.” Or saying, on the subject of fighting under General George Patton: “It was his courage and our blood.” “We were hoping for glorious war stories,” Thomas Jr. wrote in the reminiscence. “The best we got from him was how filthy they were and how they could never get comfortable because their bodies were covered in lice. Their greatest luxury was turning over their helmets and filling them with soap and water for an occasional bath.” The Veterans Day parade in New York City today will begin at 12:30 p.m., marching north from 26th Street and Fifth Avenue.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.101,0.827,0.073,-0.9499

Shear,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/us/politics/biden-veterans-day.html,Biden Marks First Veterans Day in Two Decades Without Troops in Active Combat,"WASHINGTON — President Biden paid homage on Thursday to veterans, calling them the “solid steel spine” of the United States and the “soul of America” as he marked the first Veterans Day in two decades without troops engaged in an active war overseas. For Mr. Biden, who ended the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan this summer, the moment was clearly a personal one as he expressed his gratitude to the thousands of service members and their families who were affected by the fighting in that country. In short but somber remarks at Arlington National Cemetery, Mr. Biden thanked them for their service and pledged to ensure that those who returned from battle would receive what he called “the world-class benefits that they’ve earned.” He promised to keep pushing to expand services for veterans. “Being president of the United States, you are afforded many opportunities to try to express your love, commitment and admiration for the American people,” Mr. Biden said. “And I must say to you that the single greatest honor I’ve been afforded as president is to stand before so many of you.” Mr. Biden’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was divisive. Allies complained about his lack of consultation. Republicans criticized him for making a premature decision. And he received broad condemnation for a haphazard and chaotic evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies. Even some veterans groups expressed dismay at the way the conflict ended. But the president has repeatedly said he has no regrets about the decision to pull out of a war that he long believed should have ended years ago. In previous speeches, Mr. Biden has said he could no longer send members of the military to fight a battle that he no longer believed was in the country’s best interests. On Thursday, Mr. Biden made only a brief reference to his decision, noting that “for two decades, the lives of our service members and their families and veterans have been shaped by the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.” He noted that 53,323 Americans had been killed or wounded in the two conflicts, and he said that members of the military continued to serve in the face of threats around the globe. But the president suggested that the absence of war was an opportunity to focus attention on those who had served, survived and returned. He urged service members not to ignore the mental challenges that often follow wartime service, any more than they would ignore a wounded arm or leg when they returned home. “I want to say clearly to all our veterans, if you’re struggling — you’re so used to never asking for anything — if you’re struggling, reach out,” Mr. Biden said. “If you’re having trouble thinking about things,” he added, “it’s no different than if you had a wound in your arm.” Mr. Biden, as he has often in previous speeches, recalled his own son’s service in the military. As a major in the Delaware Army National Guard, Beau Biden spent a year in Iraq before returning to the United States and later succumbing to brain cancer. “Our grandkids learned what it meant to have their dad overseas in a war zone instead of back at home for a year, tucking them into bed and reading that story every night,” the president said. “Thousands of Americans, tens of thousands, have had that experience.” But he spent more time paying tribute to the story of the first American fighter from World War I to be put to rest at the Tomb of the Unknowns exactly 100 years ago. During Mr. Biden’s remarks, he recalled the journey the soldier made from the battlefield in France to lying in state at the Capitol in the same place that Abraham Lincoln had. “He was escorted from the Capitol by the president of the United States, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, members of Congress, General Pershing, the chiefs of staff, Medal of Honor recipients,” Mr. Biden recalled, adding, “The first unknown lies now with his brethren, unnamed warriors from later wars, fellow patriots who picked up the mantle of honor.” Before speaking, Mr. Biden participated in the annual ceremony at the tomb, placing a wreath and saluting while a bugler played taps. Afterward, he urged Americans to “stand in solemn awe of such fidelity because for us to keep faith with American veterans, we must never forget exactly what was given us.” Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Biden’s administration announced efforts to provide more support to veterans who have been exposed to environmental hazards during their service, including those who have symptoms from exposure to “burn pits” while serving overseas. The actions are aimed at making it easier for service members to link diseases and exposure to the burning of human waste and electronics, which was common on bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. The issue is personal for the president, who has said he believes his son may have developed his brain tumor because of exposure to carcinogens in the jet fuel used to set the burn pits on fire while he served in Iraq. “For the newest generation of veterans, concerns about burn pits and other exposures continue to mount,” a statement from the White House said. “The Biden-Harris administration is committed to doing more to enable timely access to services and benefits for those potentially exposed to hazardous materials.” Mr. Biden’s executive actions will lower the evidence needed for veterans to prove a link to exposure during their service, and will add several conditions to the list of diseases automatically presumed to be caused by the exposure. For those who qualify, it will be easier to apply for disability benefits and access to health care by the Department of Veterans Affairs. A correction was made on Nov. 11, 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a statistic presented by President Biden during his speech. Mr. Biden referred to the number of Americans who had been killed or wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, not just the number killed. The article also misstated the number. It is 53,323, not 52,323.

Veterans,NYT,2021,Andy Newman,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/nyregion/veterans-day-brooklyn-parade.html,"For a 96-Year-Old Veteran, the Parade Came to Him","Jack Le Vine did not march in the big Veterans Day parade up Fifth Avenue in Manhattan on Thursday, or attend the small service at the Brooklyn War Memorial. He spent the day on the block in Brooklyn where he was born, in the two-story brick-faced house with an American flag out front and photos in the window of an aircraft carrier and a cargo ship and a handsome young man in a Navy uniform. Still, there was a celebration, something of a surprise. It began after a neighbor in the South Slope neighborhood where Mr. Le Vine lives posted on the community bulletin board Nextdoor.com. “A WW2 Vet lives on 18th St. He’s 97, lives alone, and may not see another Veterans Day,” she wrote on Tuesday. “Please consider leaving a little token of gratitude.” The soldiers and sailors of Mr. Le Vine’s generation are vanishing quickly now. Nearly 99 percent of the 16 million Americans who served in the war have died, according to the National World War II Museum. There are fewer than 5,000 World War II vets left in New York City. Mr. Le Vine said that as far as he knew, none of the men he served with are still around. And so, he said, he usually spends Veterans Day doing exactly “nothing.” But by Wednesday evening, the tributes had begun. As Mr. Le Vine was taking out the trash, a woman he’d never met handed him an envelope with “Jack the Hero” written on it. “I just want to thank you for your service,” she said. Then a man who lives down the block walked up with his two children and handed Mr. Le Vine a thick stack of cards that the children and their classmates had made. “You’ll be reading these for days,” said the man, Chris Polony. When Mr. Le Vine poked his head out Thursday morning, on the bench inside the gate where he and his wife used to sit, someone had left a potted amaryllis and a card tied to it with a drawing of a soldier in camouflage. “Thank you for fighting for our country. From Abigail, age 7.” On the porch by the screen door were two more letters. Mr. Le Vine, a slight but entirely unbowed man who for the record will not be 97 till January, bent and picked them up. “These people must love me on this block!” he said. Mr. Le Vine, one of seven children, joined the Navy a few weeks before his 18th birthday because his oldest brother had been drafted into the Army and warned him against it: “He came home from basic training and he said, ‘All they teach you is to crawl around on your hands and knees in the mud. You get all slopped up.’” The Navy, he said, promised “cleaner living.” He served two years in the Pacific on the U.S.S. Lesuth, then was a machinist’s mate first class on the U.S.S. Gilbert Islands, an aircraft carrier that sent fighter pilots to strike Japanese positions in Okinawa and the Sakashima Islands while Mr. Le Vine labored in the engine room. “When they said, ‘Man your battle stations,’ my battle station was the throttle,” he said. “I controlled the speed of the boat.” On top of the china cabinet in the tidy dining room of his house, a photo of Mr. Le Vine as a captain in the New York City Fire Department — where he served for 20 years starting in 1957 — sits beside a photo of a woman with laughing eyes, his wife, Joan. “She died of Alzheimer’s,” Mr. Le Vine said. “This was her bedroom — the bed was up against this wall. I took care of her six or seven years.” Hanging from the knob is a vest with medals, still displayed from when he taught World War II history to a group of local children in the living room a few years ago. Mr. Le Vine pointed to the chairs still lined up along the wall. Then he spotted movement out the window, behind the blinds. “Is somebody coming?” A woman left another card. Beside it were a miniature cypress tree, and another card, and a bakery box tied up with string that Mr. Le Vine recognized as the handiwork of a neighbor. “That’s her famous banana bread.” The woman who posted on Nextdoor, Elizabeth Dowling, 44, said Mr. Le Vine had been a friend since she moved to the block about nine years ago. She said she had reached out to her neighbors because “when our vets return home, they’re often forgotten and ignored.” A few minutes later there was another rustling. Mr. Le Vine went to the door and stopped — “No, wait a minute” — to grab a ball cap from a hook. “World War II Veteran,” it said. “Proudly Served.” Outside were a mother on in-line skates and twin 8-year-olds on scooters. The girl had made a flag of pink, white and turquoise tissue paper and affixed it to a paper towel tube and hung it from the gatepost. “We are so, so grateful,” the mother, Ariel Clark, told Mr. Le Vine. “My grandfather was in Auschwitz.” Her voice tightened and sped up. “My father was born in a displaced persons camp and so” — she gestured at her children — “without you, none of this would be possible.” She began to weep. A droplet formed at the end of Mr. Le Vine’s nose. He squinted. He shook the hands of Ms. Clark and her children, posed for a picture with them and went back inside. “My eyes water sometimes,” he said.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.07,0.892,0.037,-0.9849
Veterans,NYT,2020,Jeremy Stern,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/opinion/veterans-day-trump.html,A Veteran’s Search for Meaning,"“I don’t get it,” President Trump is reported to have said in 2017 while standing at Arlington National Cemetery. “What was in it for them?” Taken out of its vile context, the president’s question doesn’t have an immediately obvious answer, and the reflexive barrage of veteran worship that came in response didn’t shed much light. As with similar past flare-ups, this one was quickly extinguished with the mass incantation that America’s troops “defend our freedom.” It’s nice to know people think that, but in the five years I spent in the U.S. military, I never met anyone who seriously thought that’s what they were doing. Soldiers who talk that way are usually in basic training, or making up for a lack of combat experience, like the civilian who overcompensates for never serving by lighting Colin Kaepernick jerseys on fire. Truth to tell, very little of a soldier’s time is spent guarding the “American way of life,” as the Soldier’s Creed has it, and motivations tend to be fairly straightforward. Shooting an anti-tank missile at a Toyota Hilux, lighting up a fuel tank with a 50-caliber machine gun, getting blisters and dysentery and going to sleep cold and hungry in a dirt hole — these are all part of a rich personal and fraternal experience that doesn’t necessarily require any higher source of inspiration. In 2014, I joined one of the military’s most lethal career fields, the Army’s bomb squad. I wanted the adventure and glory of Special Operations, but knew I wouldn’t make a good “doorkicker,” which left helicopters and bomb disposal. I’d seen the “Hurt Locker” recently, and the decision was a quick one. (According to the medical community, the rational part of one’s brain doesn’t fully develop until age 25.) In the end, I got most of what I thought I wanted: adventure, camaraderie, swag. But glory, alas, lay just out of reach. I deployed to five countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, but I never fought a great battle, never defused a suicide vest with my bare hands, never liberated a village whose name I could lend to my memoirs. It’s a curious agony, not being shot at. Without such scars, one fears being seen — strictly within military circles, of course — as a loser or sucker. Fresh from that experience, I’ve been thinking about a better answer to Mr. Trump’s question. What was in it for me? *** It is never desirable to put troops in harm’s way, but remember to enlist is to expect just that. Many soldiers actually get upset when something goes badly wrong and they miss it. A soldier in my platoon hadn’t skipped a combat patrol for over two months, during which he saw no action. One morning he came down with the norovirus and spent the day vomiting. When the patrol left that night, he stayed behind. The team proceeded to engage in a protracted firefight, complete with explosive belts, exploding trucks and enemy bodies. I’d never known him to sulk, but for the rest of the deployment he was nearly catatonic, struggling to conceal the depths of his melancholy. About a thousand kilometers away, on a small base, I shared his misery. We sometimes saw nearby ballistic missile fire and would get alerts on our phones and computers instructing us to seek shelter from incoming projectiles, which we took as our signal to run outside and capture the attack on Snapchat. But the missiles were consistently inaccurate, and the air defense systems were frustratingly competent. If being a hero is hard, and defending your way of life is not really part of the job, what makes a good soldier? Some big things, but mostly small ones. There are the true warriors, the Audie Murphys and John McCains. They belong to a rare caste I don’t pretend to understand. Suffice it to say the soldier you thanked at the airport probably wasn’t one of them. A good soldier loves her job, and spends her free time becoming world-class. She guides younger soldiers through the byzantine promotion system, and protects them from the bureaucratic predations of higher headquarters. She has an eye for destructive behavior. She is obsessed with training her soldiers, but takes no credit for their success. She puts the mission first, but she also makes sure no one misses a graduation, an anniversary, a soccer game that doesn’t need to be missed. None of that gets you eternal glory. It just repays your soldiers’ trust, which they have no choice but to give you. But the soldier you thanked at the airport may not be much like her, either. Soldiers are like schoolteachers. Some relatively small number are exceptional, the best America has to offer. Some small percentage are toxic, capable of ruining lives and entire organizations. And a large portion sit somewhere in the middle, meeting whatever standard has been set to keep the machine running, serving their country, earning their pay, and working toward their pension, along with a few wild stories to regale friends and family. Soldiers are like teachers in another way: It’s hard to screw up so badly that you lose your job. Everyone in the military knows this (and knows someone who should’ve been kicked out but wasn’t), which is why many service members regard the arbitrary gratitude of sycophantic strangers with a mix of appreciation and ridicule. They know these are just the trappings of America’s post-draft bargain. Under the terms of this deal, less than half a percent of Americans serve in the active-duty military, and everyone else agrees to revere them. When I first enlisted, I was surprised how many of the people in my life suddenly had stories about how they once — almost — joined the military, too. If it wasn’t for this asthma medication or that knee surgery or an ailing relative, my progressive California suburb apparently would’ve been overrun with military recruits. None of them took the idea seriously enough to discover that the military has had enlistment waivers for such things. But I got the point. Even people who didn’t want or have to serve still seem strangely self-conscious when faced with those who chose to, or had no choice. When asked why I did it, I usually prattle on about patriotism and giving back. That’s part of it, too. But I still don’t have a frank, pithy answer, because when I think back, I don’t really know. I don’t know why anyone does it, other than that it’s a good job with a slightly higher risk-reward ratio. There are certainly other jobs to choose from, even if glory is what you’re after. It is a trying and amusing life. Within a few weeks of taking over a platoon, a newly minted lieutenant nursing martial fantasies will quickly find herself occupied instead with a parade of eccentric melodramas: one soldier’s former spouse demanding disciplinary action under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for giving her chlamydia; an angry call from the president’s Secret Service detail accusing a soldier of helping himself to a morning buffet without wearing pants. Even in the heat of the fight, she may find herself less the protagonist of an epic than the bewildered witness to a series of bizarre spectacles: a soldier testing out a new-generation armored vehicle by intentionally driving it over an I.E.D.; a soldier trying to locate a buried vat of white phosphorus by kicking the ground and lighting his foot on fire. There are the long nights and early mornings, the compressed discs and fractured hips, the last-second missions and ambiguous orders, the cutting-edge technology and shortages of food, the labyrinthine bureaucracy and paperwork. There are the waits, delays, postponements, setbacks, extensions, reversals, retractions and cancellations, the myriad spouses and children cowed by experience into anticipation of disappointment. I take my hat off to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who make the military a life’s work. I didn’t do in five years what many of them have done in an afternoon, and to the military they will give the remainder of their youth, if not, in the end, their lives. As for me, I’m finished. I left last year, and for whatever reason, I hadn’t thought about it much since. But back in September, when I saw reports of Mr. Trump’s comments at Arlington, certain memories resurfaced. I got out the pictures, the videos, the passports, the patches, the uniforms. My old helmet, my old bag of tools. It was an odd sensation. I felt as though I was never a soldier, so much as I played one once. Would that have been different if I’d been shot? If I’d liberated a village? If I could point to a great cause and say, “I fought for that.” In a word, if I found meaning? It’s only at the end, when you think less of the battles you fought than the places you saw and the people you loved, that you realize there was meaning all along, and that’s what was in it for you.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.11,0.761,0.128,0.9895
Veterans,NYT,2020,Debra Weiner,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/well/family/for-veterans-day-some-former-military-officers-reflect-on-lessons-from-their-parents.html,"For Veterans Day, Some Former Military Officers Reflect on Lessons From Their Parents","Leadership. JIM DUBIK, retired U.S. Army lieutenant general. Commanding general for training the Iraqi forces during the surge of 2007-08; Senior Fellow, Institute for the Study of War; author, “Just War Reconsidered: Strategy, Ethics and Theory.” My dad was an Army corporal in World War II and a sergeant in the Korean War, and worked at a plastics factory in the shipping and receiving department, so from a world standpoint, a regular guy. But he knew so much about how to lead, how to get the best out of somebody and, as a boys’ baseball coach, he taught me things about leadership that have been fundamental for the rest of my life. I was probably 12, and it was the bottom of the last inning. There were two outs. The bases were loaded, and this kid was up but refused to bat because he was so anxious. He implored my dad to put somebody else in, but my dad said, “No, this is your turn. I have confidence in you.” Well, the kid swung, missed and got even more nervous. He swung again, fouled, and this time walked out of the batter’s box. My dad was coaching third base and came down, talked to him, hugged him and put him back in the box. Then he turned around and told the parents in the stands to cheer. And whack, he got a hit. In high school, I started coaching with my dad. I’d say, “You know, if we play this other guy longer, we’ll have a better chance of winning.” And he’d say, “Yeah. But I’m not here to win. I’m here to have every kid be proud of himself and how he was part of the team.” It was the same philosophy when I went into the Army. I was 21, right out of college, commissioned to be a second lieutenant in the infantry, and Dad said, “Remember, you’re an officer and people are going to look up to you. But the people looking up to you may die as a result of your orders. Don’t treat them like cogs in a wheel. Treat them with dignity. Respect them for what they’re willing to do.” When I was a major, I was a deputy commander of a Ranger battalion and one of the higher-ups, a colonel, was really not good. He told me at one point, “Stop thinking. I’ve thought of everything. I don’t need suggestions from you.” At the time, I didn’t know he was going through a personal crisis and stress from a recent combat tour. But when you’re a major and go head-to-head with a colonel, you lose. It’s that simple. So I said to myself, “What are you going to do? Change your M.O. and suck up so you succeed, but in the process screw the people that work for you? No way.” Getting promoted was not worth my integrity. That time I didn’t need to talk to my dad. I was channeling him. Luckily, that colonel was an anomaly in my career. I saw way too much as a kid. Mom was a strong woman but struggled with health issues and because of that got taken advantage of emotionally, mentally and physically. I didn’t spend a whole lot of time with my father. He always made sure I had what I needed, and would feed my two older sisters — we don’t share the same dad — and even the adults in my mom’s house, just to make sure I ate. But I rarely stayed at his place. Mostly he picked me up and brought me over to his sister’s or his mother’s. Just before my brother died of cancer, he asked me what I thought about death. I said “Bob, in wartime death is random, instant and final. It’s completely out of your control. What is in control is how you live, and you lived well.” And that’s back to my dad. If you live your life with the right set of values, when death arrives you’re able to, in military terms, come to the position of attention, do an about-face, and be proud of what you see. Be Your Own Person. JAS BOOTHE, former U.S. Army major. International public speaker and founder of Final Salute Inc., a nationwide nonprofit that provides homeless women veterans and their children with transitional housing. My father was a fear-of-God, worst-case scenario kind of person. Every time he talked to me, it was about being strong and protecting myself. I’d be 8 or 9, and he’d be like, “Don’t go down that street or you’ll get shot in the head.” Or “Boys don’t care about you; they just want to have sex with you, and then you’ll get pregnant and be damaged goods.” I thought, “Dang, why is he so hard on me? Why is he so mean?” But I think that was his way of trying to keep me out of trouble. My father grew up in the ’60s, which was a harsh time to be a Black man in America. He talked about being chased home as a kid, and as an adult, people trying to take advantage of him because they didn’t think he was educated enough to understand. So he was always in survivor mode and fighting something. Fighting the power, the man, something. Even with the doctors, up until his last days, he was like, “I don’t have pancreatic cancer. They’re just trying to get my money cause I’m Black and they think I’m stupid.” He was always training me to be like a warrior. Crush people if they need to be crushed. When I was around 12, some neighborhood kids were messing with me. My mom talked to their parents, but they kept doing it. Finally I told my dad that these kids had jumped me. We drove over to where they lived, and he grabbed a little bag from under his truck seat. And he pulled out a gun. It was a silver revolver. I was like, “Oh my God, what are you doing?” And he was like, “This isn’t a game. What did you think I was going to do?” “Uh, not murder a whole houseful of people because their kids are bullies. I don’t like this. Let’s just go.” I’ve never been religious but I’ve always felt spiritually led; that there was a protective presence around me pushing me away from negative influences and behaviors. I mean, I respected my parents. And there probably were reasons I never knew about that caused them to live their lives a certain way. But I realized I had the ability to shape how my life would turn out. It wasn’t like I got a notepad and wrote down all the ways I’m not going to be like my parents. But I guess I took subconscious notes. “Nah, that’s not for me. I won’t go down that route.” I never called my father dad — he was always Mickey — until I was 27. I was getting ready to go to Iraq when I got head, neck and throat cancer. I was in the hospital for six months and was talking to him on the phone one day, when he said, “Hey, you think you can start calling me Dad?” I think because I was, quote, “weak and very vulnerable,” he finally saw me as his little girl and felt like I needed a daddy. It was like the universe letting me know I was going to get through the cancer. And after that, until the point he passed, we had the greatest relationship. Despite how different we were, I’m still my father’s daughter. The Golden Rule. STANLEY McCHRYSTAL, retired U.S. Army general Commander of Joint Special Operations Command in the mid-2000s; commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, 2009-2010; currently a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. My mom always treated people kindly and with consideration. She never talked about it or wore it on her sleeve. It was just what she did. I remember, when I was 6, my brother and I spent two or three weeks in Lafayette, Ala., at the family homestead, this big, brick, Victorian-looking thing which my great-grandfather had built. My mother flew down to pick us up and when she arrived in her traveling clothes, which in those days were nice clothes, some of the relatives came out to greet her. Then the cook, a heavyset African-American lady who had been with the family for years, came out and was effusive with my mother. And then this one-armed guy who wore a straw hat and worked on the farm, Old Mose they called him, came up and goes, “Miss Mary Gardner.” It was almost like you were at Twelve Oaks or something. And my mom greets him in a really personal way, like he mattered. I wasn’t real conscious of race before that trip to the South, but I was struck by how my mom acted differently than my relatives. Not that they were mean. They were just of that society. I played in a very competitive Little League and there was one game, I was pitching, when a father on the other team started heckling me. Who heckles a 12-year-old? So I heckled back. I thought I was very clever standing up to this old guy. But after the game, my mom goes, just because somebody acts the fool, doesn’t make it OK for you to act the fool. I said, point taken. When you get to be very senior, not just in the military but also in politics and business, it can make you feel entitled. Privilege, which is a kind of power, can corrupt insidiously. When I was in Afghanistan, American soldiers would sometimes look at the Afghans who were working on the post and literally see through them, as if they were not people. It wasn’t intentional. It wasn’t, “I hate Afghans.” But it’s what people do with the “help.” My mother died when I was 16. She got up New Year’s Day — she hadn’t been out or drinking a thing the night before — and started feeling strange. My father took her to Walter Reed. She was having some kind of kidney failure and by 2 the next morning, she was dead. But even now, when I act in a way that isn’t the best I can be, I go, boy, my mom would not be happy about that. Being respectful of people is the compass I try to live by. But you can do everything right and fail. You can do everything wrong and win. So where I’ve come to is, intentions and effort matter more than the outcome. I try to do what is right simply because I know that’s what I should do. Optimism. JAMES STAVRIDIS, retired U.S. Navy admiral. The 16th Supreme Allied Commander of NATO; former dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University; author of nine books, including a novel to be published in March. In 1922, my father’s mother was living in Smyrna in western Turkey when the Greeks and Armenians were herded down to the harbor and the Turkish army burned the city behind them. She was rescued by Greek fisherman who came across the Aegean to bring them to Greece. In Athens, she met my grandfather and these two 20-somethings took a ship for America and went through Ellis Island. My grandparents always believed that was a profoundly positive experience and transmitted that to my father. In all the 50-plus years I was around him, I never saw him fail to meet the moment with a sense that things will work out. Not in a Pollyanna way — he was a combat Marine; he saw plenty of the dark side of the world — but that if you move with a positive force and face the challenges in front of you, good would outdo evil in the long throw of a life. In 1966, my dad was preparing to go to Vietnam for a one-year deployment. I was in middle school and watched him pack his sea bag and put it by the door. I think most people would have been pretty downbeat, thinking I’m getting on a plane in the morning and going into a combat situation. But my dad was so positive in conveying that he would be fine. “I’m going with a battalion of 1,000 Marines to a coastal port called Da Nang. I am their commander. We protect each other. Our mission is to ensure that our ships can come in and out.” He talked about how they would set up perimeter defenses. Fence barriers would be constructed. He took the esoteric idea of what he was going to be doing and surrounded it in my mind with reality and protection. My father was a tennis player and spent a lot of time teaching me the game. I was in high school and would often be overmatched. I’d say to him, “I’ll never beat that kid. He’s ranked No. 2 in the state. I’m No. 20.” But my dad would say, “No, no, no. Let’s analyze his game. Where are his weaknesses? His strengths? And how do you counter them next time you meet? Even if you lose tactically, you can learn from it strategically.” I’ve thought about that a lot over the years. Your business may fail; you may get terminal cancer; you may have a relationship that fails. But even if there is significant failure, draw lessons from it and apply them to the next situation. On 9/11, I was a newly selected, one-star admiral, and my office in the Pentagon was on the side where the airplane hit. I was 150 feet away, and watched it happen. In the Navy, you learn how to firefight, so my initial instinct was to run toward the explosion. But there was so much smoke, there was nothing I could do. It took me 3 ½ hours to walk home. My wife had no idea if I’d survived. We had a moment, then I called my father. Like everybody who would be honest about it, I was afraid. Afraid for the country, afraid for my family, afraid for what was happening. But my father snapped me out of it. He said, “We are not going to be taken down by a terrorist organization. You’re an officer in the U.S. military. You have to get back to the Pentagon. This is your moment. Admiral.” That was not quite the last time I spoke with my father, but among the last. He died of an aneurysm days later, on Sept. 16. He was 76. Make the Most of It. SUNITA WILLIAMS, retired U.S. Navy captain. NASA astronaut who has spent 322 days in space and performed seven spacewalks; currently training to fly the second crewed mission of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station. My dad grew up in Ahmedabad in India. He was 2 when he lost his dad; 11 when he lost his mom. He lived with his older sister until she got married, but by 14 he was fending for himself. He decided he needed to live around people, so he got himself into boarding school and made his way to become one of the top neuroscientists in the world. My mom is from Euclid, Ohio. Her parents were blue-collar workers who immigrated from Slovenia. Instead of marrying a Slovenian guy from the neighborhood, she met my dad. He was a doctor in the hospital where she worked as an X-ray technician, and he dragged her to Boston. But my mom, like my dad, has confidence in going with where the wind blows. She learned to play tennis, got us involved in swimming, took advantage of the mountains and camping. She became a lifeguard at Babson College in order to get us a membership to the pool. We’d go over there and she’d be folding towels. When I was 17, it was the morning of the Boston Marathon, and I was mowing the lawn, frumping around, feeling sorry for myself. I was getting ready to go to the Naval Academy, which was not my first choice, and thinking, man, I’ll never get to run this race because who knows if I’ll ever come home again. Finally my mom said, “I don’t want to hear you complaining any more. Get in the station wagon.” Then she drove me to the starting line. “Here’s a quarter. If you can’t finish, call.” At the halfway point, I saw her on a bridge and ran over and said, “I think I’m done.” I didn’t have running shoes and was running in high-tops, so it’d been tough. But then this guy ran over and asked my mom, who had a jar of Gatorade, if he could have some. My mom was like, sure. Then the guy said to me, “C’mon, you can finish this.” My mom said, “Yeah, go for it.” And I was like, “OK, but I can’t run in these stupid shoes anymore.” So I took them off, gave them to my mom and ran the second half with the guy barefoot. The first time I applied to become an astronaut, I got rejected. But some friends in the class ahead at test pilot school were selected and they wrote telling me to apply again. “Suni, this is right up your alley. It’s so much fun.” They recommended I get a master’s degree. So while I did my sea tour, I went to night school. It was hard. I had to drive three hours to take classes, and I wasn’t sure if there’d be any benefit. But I’d seen my parents do stuff that wasn’t the most flattering or fun, because potentially it could lead to something else. So I thought, even if this sucks, just do it. I came to the astronaut office in 1998. There were a lot of us, so who knew when you would get a flight assignment. Then in 2003, the Columbia accident happened, and it was like, “Wow, will any of us ever fly? Should I quit?” So I had a little talk with myself. “Hey Suni, you have the opportunity to get physically fit; you have the opportunity to go to Russia and learn Russian, and meet people from an entirely different space agency. Even if you never fly, you’re one of the luckiest people in the whole wide world.” Life gives you what it gives you. Make the most of it. And that’s how my parents were. They made the best of any situation. They looked at the big picture, then picked up the pieces and handled them with grace, whatever they were.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.087,0.804,0.109,0.9965
Veterans,NYT,2019,Karen Zraick,https://www.nytimes.com/article/veterans-day-armistice-day.html?searchResultPosition=2,How Armistice Day Became Veterans Day in the United States,"On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. “King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,” The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. The fighting had destroyed empires, transformed Europe’s borders, spurred advances in weaponry and manufacturing, and brought millions of women into the work force. Wilson’s statement said: With splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns we remodeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. … Out of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes. The Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended the war, had been signed earlier that year, on June 28, 1919. In 1953, Alvin J. King of Emporia, Kan., proposed changing the name of the holiday to Veterans Day, to recognize veterans from all wars and conflicts. According to a 2003 congressional resolution recognizing his efforts, the holiday was first celebrated in that small city, about 60 miles southwest of Topeka, the same year. The resolution noted that while Mr. King was not a veteran himself, his stepson John Cooper, whom he had raised, was killed in combat during World War II. The community raised money to send Mr. King and his wife, Gertrude, to Washington to meet with officials and push them to change the name of the federal holiday. They received crucial support from Representative Edward H. Rees, also of Emporia. President Dwight D. Eisenhower made the change the following year. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978. Memorial Day, on the other hand, is observed on the last Monday in May. Whereas Veterans Day honors all veterans, Memorial Day specifically honors those who gave their lives for the United States. This year also marked the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944, to fight the Nazi occupation. British Commonwealth nations and some other European countries also mark the anniversary of the armistice with ceremonies on or around Remembrance Sunday. In London, a National Service of Remembrance is held each year at the Cenotaph, a war memorial, and bright red paper poppies are worn as a symbol of support for the armed forces. In the bombed-out countryside of Western Europe after World War I, Flanders poppies, which were resilient enough to grow amid the destruction, became potent symbols. A Canadian doctor, Lt. Col. John McCrae, described them in the poem “In Flanders Fields.” The Royal British Legion, a charity founded in 1921 that supports the armed forces, adopted the poppy as its emblem and set up a warehouse to employ disabled ex-servicemen to produce poppies. The tradition has endured, and public figures who have declined to wear the poppy have faced criticism. (There are also white poppies for pacifists, purple ones for animal lovers and, this year, apparently false reports of rainbow ones for supporters of L.G.B.T. rights.) The organization’s American corollary, the American Legion, also uses the red poppy as its official flower, and has promoted the Friday before Memorial Day as National Poppy Day.

Veterans,NYT,2019,Matt Stevens,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/veterans-day-2020-democrats.html,How the 2020 Democrats Plan to Help Veterans,"The large field of Democrats running for president may have differing views on the best way to provide health care to the masses or exactly how to reform the immigration system. But when it comes to helping America’s veterans they largely agree: The Department of Veterans Affairs needs some serious help, and those who have served need much better access to benefits, health care, housing, education and jobs. On Veterans Day, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont released extensive plans outlining how they would help them. They follow a similarly detailed proposal unveiled last week by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and they join a lengthy list of policy plans released by candidates throughout the summer and fall. Here’s a closer look at the measures Democrats are calling for, and how their proposals contrast with what President Trump has already done. Improve and update the V.A. Almost every candidate agrees that the V.A. needs to be able to function better than it currently does and has pledged to give the agency the resources it needs to work efficiently. Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are among those who have called for the agency to fill its more than 49,000 staffing vacancies. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, among others, have said they would invest in modernizing V.A. hospitals, clinics and other infrastructure. And in a commonly heard refrain, several Democrats have promised to eliminate the perennial “benefits backlog” that forces tens of thousands of veterans to wait for a determination on the benefits they can receive. Provide veterans with better care. Several candidates have promised that under their administrations, veterans would get access to affordable and comprehensive health care. Under that umbrella, candidates like Mr. Sanders have specifically promised to guarantee dental care, expand the V.A.’s comprehensive caregiver program and other measures. Multiple candidates also have called attention to veteran suicide and pledged to invest in research, mental health services and housing to help address the issue. Ms. Warren has said she would aim to reduce the number of veteran suicides by 50 percent within her first term. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey suggested appointing a White House official solely focused on working across agencies to cut the suicide rate. Senator Kamala Harris of California, meanwhile, is among those who have called for expanding access to health care and housing assistance for veterans with “other-than-honorable” discharges, which they may have received because they experienced trauma or other reasons beyond their control. Improve access to education, training and jobs
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and other candidates have also outlined ways to support veterans once they re-enter civilian life. For instance, Ms. Klobuchar has proposed extending G.I. Bill education benefits to members of the National Guard and Reserve and implementing a grant program that would invest in veteran education centers. Several candidates have also said they would expand and improve incentives for companies to hire veterans, and that they would direct government agencies to invest in more veteran-owned businesses and entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur Andrew Yang has argued for what he calls a “reverse boot camp” which would seek to help veterans adjust to life after the military by training them in skills like cooking, financial literacy and how to interview for a job. Ensuring equal treatment Candidates also promised to rescind Mr. Trump’s ban on transgender servicemembers, stand up for victims of sexual assault in the military and protect veterans and family members of servicemembers from deportation. Ms. Warren has called the ban on transgender servicemembers “shameful.” And Mr. Buttigieg said his administration would reach out to people who were discharged because of their gender identity and give them a chance to re-enlist. Ms. Klobuchar said in her proposal that more than 20,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted in 2018. She and other Democrats have proposed various ways to strengthen the prosecution of perpetrators and expand access to counseling for victims. In her plan, Ms. Warren noted that protections from deportation for veterans have been eroding under the Trump administration, and pledged to restart a program that makes it easier for noncitizens who serve to become naturalized. What Trump has already done. Mr. Trump, who kicked off the 100th annual New York City Veterans Day Parade in Manhattan on Monday, has also sought to court veterans, a group he views as a key piece of his political base. Public polls have found that Mr. Trump’s support among veterans outpaces his support from the public at large. He has garnered praise from some veterans for railing against “endless wars,” much like the 2020 Democratic candidate Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard who has served two combat tours in the Middle East. Mr. Trump campaigned in 2016 on wanting to put more veterans in private health care. To help accomplish that goal, Congress passed health care legislation known as the Mission Act in 2018 and the V.A. rolled out new rules this year that allowed a broad group of enrollees to seek care outside the agency. Though Mr. Trump has heralded the program as great success, it has struggled to grow its network of doctors to meet coverage demands. For all his talk of supporting veterans, Mr. Trump has also sometimes snubbed them.He admitted in court documents that he gave his campaign control over how to spend $2.8 million that his charity raised through what was ostensibly a fund-raiser for veterans. Last year, he chose to forgo a traditional visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, a decision that led him to issue a rare apology. He drew wide condemnation during the 2016 campaign when he criticized the parents of a slain soldier who had denounced him, and he frequently attacked the late Senator John McCain, saying the former Navy pilot and prisoner of war was “not a war hero.”",0.0,0.722,0.278,0.4019,0.079,0.74,0.181,0.9988
Veterans,NYT,2019,Matt Gallagher,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/opinion/trump-veterans-day.html,A Very Trumpish Veterans Day,"NEW YORK — A half-moon of garbage trucks rung the southern fringe of Madison Square Park, barriers to keep the parade dignitaries and V.I.P.s insulated from the throng. Loud men with bullhorns moved through the crowd, issuing orders for various veterans groups, while teenage cadets fidgeted in olive drab uniforms that fit their bodies like papier-mâché. The morning smacked of crisp autumn air and rich star-spangled pomp, and for a few seconds at least, I allowed myself to pretend this would be a normal Veterans Day in the city. A day of remembrance, a day of somber celebration, a day of unity. Then my eyes found the garbage trucks again. A microphone grumbled to life in the park across the street. Whatever this was going to be, it was going to be different. An older man wearing a camouflage hat with the words NAVY VETERAN on it looked across the street with me. I could feel him sizing me up. “You booing?” he asked. “Or cheering?” It was the question most every vet was asking each other as we gathered for the parade, whatever our era, whatever our war. To boo the commander in chief on this day, in 2019 America, would be an overtly political act, the kind of political act prohibited in uniform and still often frowned upon after it. Of course, so would cheering the commander in chief. These are treacherous times and the only thing worse than picking a side is not. “Not cheering,” I said. “I know that much.” The older man just laughed. There’s always a bit of spectacle to Veterans Days in New York. In the decade since I got out of the army, I’ve marched in a couple and worked a couple others for a veterans’ nonprofit. Something about the day’s ambiguous intent (the offspring of Armistice Day in the era of forever war is a dark, twisted irony) and our nation’s many proud battle triumphs and myths produce a strange blend of earnest patriotism every November. It’s a day and place where conquerors, protesters, bona fides and posers alike can come together and be together. In recent years, I’ve chosen to spend Veterans Day in quiet reflection, taking my young son to a museum, or our family dog to the park. But the parade keeps a special place in my soul — the 2011 version did a lot to prove to my younger, more combustible self recently returned from Iraq that, yes, American citizens did care about the wars being fought in their name, they just didn’t know any better than I did what to do with all that care and pride and rage. That mattered to me. It still does. The 2019 parade didn’t bring that same sense of renewal. Presidents usually go to the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington on Veterans Day but not this year. This year, the president came to the parade and brought with him a very different kind of spectacle. Hundreds milled around the staging area near Madison Square Park, maybe waiting for the actual parade, maybe just here for this, another front in the nation’s ongoing culture war. There was a man dressed as a World War I doughboy. There was another dressed as an African military dictator. Uncle Sam handed out restaurant coupons. The top floor of a nearby office building put up a simple homemade sign in its window: “IMPEACH.” The energy along the verges of the parade ceremony and park was sharp, even angry. Possible violence is something you can feel, if you’ve been around a bit of it, and this had that in spades, even before a tall, bearded man approached anti-Trump protesters and screamed, “You’re disgusting!” into their faces over and over. A baby-faced policeman came over to separate the participants. I asked him how old he was on 9/11. He didn’t like the question but still gave me an answer: “Young.” The microphone in the park grumbled to be again, and the Marine Band played “Hail to the Chief,” and the president was introduced. He began his speech. On a television replay I’d watch later, his speech was subdued and, for him, temperate. Beyond the sanctum of garbage trucks, though, the crowd grew more agitated. A chant of “Trump 2020” was met with a sing-songy, sarcastic “Bone Spurs.” Bursts of “U-S-A” followed. A veteran wearing a red MAGA hat yelled at a veteran wearing a VETS AGAINST TRUMP shirt and accused him of being a fraud. He, in turn, called the man in the MAGA hat a mouthbreather. (This validated his veteran status in my mind: that’s a military insult, through and through.) A NATO flag was waved and so was a Trump flag and a couple of pimply-faced Trump kids asked a passer-by what her “Peshmerga” shirt meant. She explained and they nodded, seemingly impressed. “I disagree with what he [President Trump] did to the Kurds,” one said calmly in the maelstrom. Only splashes of the speech could reach our ears. The president’s clear delight at retelling the death of the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi caused a stir in the crowd, then a series of groans and head shakes, then more ‘U-S-A” chants. A man wearing a signboard (and little else) that said “Jeffrey Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself” wondered aloud when the speech would end — it was going on too long, he believed. And then on the other side of the metal gates, a man in a wheelchair wearing a World War II hat rolled by, holding a miniature American flag. “I love America!” he called to the crowd. Everyone — everyone — cheered. The president’s speech ended. A 21-gun salute echoed through the metal-gray sky. The sense of possible violence dissipated, and a young man in Trump-branded overalls took photographs with a middle-age woman wearing a large Bernie Sanders necklace. Things began to feel more normal. Weird in the way Veterans Day is supposed to be weird. Thirty minutes later, as our group waited to enter the parade on 24th Street, I watched a man who said he was a Desert Storm veteran confront two women holding anti-Trump signs. He called them libtards and ungrateful. The women didn’t back down. A man wearing a Vietnam veteran shirt stepped forward to intervene. “They’re patriots,” he said. “And I agree with them.” The Desert Storm veteran looked at the other’s shirt. “Where’s your honor?” he asked. “Honor’s what brought me here today,” the older man said. Then he held up his own anti-Trump sign. “Same,” said the other man. Then they just kind of stared at each other for a few seconds before turning away.
As we marched up Fifth Avenue, ciphers and proxies for a republic as divided as we are about our elected leader, I thought a lot about those men and about honor, too. I should’ve said something, I thought, to bring them together. It was Veterans Day, after all. What that thing was to say, though, I still don’t know.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.09,0.838,0.072,-0.9824
Veterans,NYT,2019,Michael Gold,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/nyregion/trump-veterans-day-parade-nyc.html,"Veterans Day: Trump Returns to N.Y. for Parade, to Cheers and Boos","President Trump returned to his hometown on Monday to kick off the 100th annual New York City Veterans Day Parade, his second visit to the city since he announced he was making Florida his primary home. In an 18-minute speech, Mr. Trump expressed his gratitude to American veterans, but also used his remarks to pay tribute to the city, where he remains deeply unpopular. “Since the earliest days of our nation, New York has exemplified the American spirit and has been at the heart of our nation’s story of daring and defiance,” Mr. Trump said. Defiance, in particular, was on display throughout Mr. Trump’s speech, at Madison Square Park in Manhattan, just two miles down Fifth Avenue from Trump Tower, which had been Mr. Trump’s primary residence since 1983, until he filed to switch it to Florida in late September. Even before the president arrived, protesters had gathered along the streets, a number of them from an anti-Trump group, Rise and Resist. They carried signs calling for Mr. Trump’s impeachment and repeatedly shouted, “Shame!” In the windows of a nearby glass tower overlooking the dais where Mr. Trump spoke, large signs placed in the windows spelled the word “impeach.” A few floors higher, letters spelling “convict” were placed in another set of windows. As Mr. Trump, who is the first sitting president to take part in the parade, addressed the crowd, he was met with claps and cheers as he listed specific American military victories and recounted stories of individual veterans. “Today, we come together as one nation to salute the veterans of the United States Armed Forces, the greatest warriors to ever walk the face of the Earth,” Mr. Trump said. Some of his supporters gathered nearby, many of them wearing hats bearing Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” But raucous boos and chants jeering Mr. Trump could also be heard throughout the president’s remarks. A chorus of people shouted “lock him up!” and “traitor” and blew whistles as he spoke, causing some veterans to complain that the din was drowning out the president’s speech. “Vote him out if you don’t like him,” said Dennis Currier, 72, a Bronx resident who served in combat in the Vietnam War. “But don’t come here and be disrespectful on Veterans Day. They have a right to demonstrate, but there’s a time and a place for that.” The only time the protesters fell silent was during a moment of silence and a wreath-laying ceremony honoring fallen soldiers. Elliot Crown, 47, came to Mr. Trump's speech wearing army fatigues, a clown nose and a farcical oversized mustache. He and a friend carried a sign reading “Operation Bone Spur,” a reference to a diagnosis that allowed Mr. Trump to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. “He’s always pretending to be something he’s not,” Mr. Crown said. “And he certainly isn’t a supporter of veterans.” Mr. Trump helped boost the parade in 1995 when it was struggling to attract donations, writing a check for over $300,000. In return, he asked to be made the grand marshal, an honor he was not bestowed because he never served in the military. Still, being honored by the parade had remained a goal of Mr. Trump’s. So when the opportunity arrived this year to take part, he was pleased. Mr. Trump has generally received more support from veterans than from the public at large. According to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center, 57 percent of veterans said they approved of the way Mr. Trump was leading the military, compared with 41 percent of adults overall. Last year, an Associated Press poll found that 56 percent of veterans said they approved of the job Mr. Trump was doing as president, compared with 42 percent of the general public. Still, Mr. Trump has been criticized by some veterans groups over incidents where he was perceived as being disrespectful to those who had served. During the campaign and his presidency, he frequently attacked Senator John McCain, saying the former Navy pilot was “not a war hero” and criticizing the senator, who died in 2018, for his record on military and veterans’ issues. Mr. Trump also drew condemnations after he disparaged the parents of a slain Muslim soldier who had strongly denounced Mr. Trump during the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Mr. Trump’s rise to the ranks of the rich and famous has been inextricably linked to New York City, and he has spoken often of his affectionate for it. He was born in Queens and built his real estate empire in Manhattan, quickly becoming a fixture in the city’s tabloid papers and sprinkling his name on buildings across the region. As Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign, he used the city as his backdrop, starting his eventual journey to the White House in the lobby of Trump Tower. But three years into his presidency, Mr. Trump’s relationship with the city has become bitter and contentious. His name was removed from residential high-rises and a hotel in SoHo after numerous complaints, and the Central Park skating rinks that his company runs diminished the presence of his name on signs. The president is also locked in a legal battle with Manhattan’s district attorney over a subpoena for his personal and business tax records. And last week New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced a $2 million settlement in a lawsuit that accused the president of using money raised by his charitable foundation to promote his presidential campaign and pay business debts. That investigation grew out of claims that a fund-raiser for veterans in January 2016 was in fact, Mr. Trump later acknowledged in court papers, a campaign event. The president’s visits to New York have often been met with protests. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump swung by an Ultimate Fighting Championship event at Madison Square Garden, where he was also met by both boos and cheers. In late September, Mr. Trump filed court documents saying that he was becoming a resident of Florida and that the Mar-a-Lago Club was his primary dwelling. On Twitter, he said that while he cherished New York, the city with which he had become closely associated during his rise to fame, he had been “treated very badly” by officials there. “Few have been treated worse,” he said. “I hated having to make this decision, but in the end it will be the best for all concerned.” Demonstrators said they were specifically targeting Mr. Trump’s speech and had no plans to protest the annual parade, in which more than 20,000 people were expected to participate. “We’re not protesting the vets, we’re protesting Trump,” said Jamie Bauer, 60, who was part of Rise and Resist. “We respect the vets, and there are several veterans in our group.”",0.0,0.78,0.22,0.4767,0.076,0.809,0.115,0.9947

Veterans,NYT,2019,Michael Wilson,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/nyregion/veterans-death-military-benefits.html,"A Black Paratrooper’s First Veterans Day, and His Last","On Monday, for the first time in his life, Needham Mayes was a veteran on Veterans Day. His hospital bed was far from any parade, but the nation’s recognition of his service was no different from that of his fellow soldiers marching beneath flying flags. It was an honor hard fought, one that had taken the 85-year-old man’s entire adult life to arrive. He had been a paratrooper in the Army, among the first black soldiers at Fort Bragg, N.C., after the military was desegregated. He had an exemplary record for more than two years. It all ended in a bar fight in 1955. Mr. Mayes was dismissed from the Army with a dishonorable discharge. The punishment was disproportionately harsh and one in which race may have played a part, his supporters said. He moved to Brooklyn, where he started over with a career in social work and therapy, a leader in the borough’s poorest communities. But as he grew old and his body weakened, he looked back at his service and sought to have his discharge upgraded to an honorable status. Mr. Mayes was dismissed from the Army with a dishonorable discharge. The punishment was disproportionately harsh and one in which race may have played a part, his supporters said. He moved to Brooklyn, where he started over with a career in social work and therapy, a leader in the borough’s poorest communities. But as he grew old and his body weakened, he looked back at his service and sought to have his discharge upgraded to an honorable status. His condition worsened in September and, at last, the Army granted his appeal. Two months later, Veterans Day found him quiet and still, unable to speak and propped on pillows as the profound significance of the day set in among those who knew him best. It was as if that were enough. Shortly before 4 p.m., doctors called his daughter Nathalie Pilgrim and said her father had gone into cardiac arrest. They were unable to revive him. “He died on Veterans Day,” she said. “That’s too much for me.” Mr. Mayes was a Southern transplant who arrived in New York City a young and broken man in the late 1950s, harboring a secret about his discharge, and the day that brought it about. He was 21 and stationed at Fort Bragg, where, on July 30, 1955, he walked into a bar on the base to meet a friend. Trouble started right away: The bar was reserved for officers, and Mr. Mayes was only a private. He wasn’t there long when a sergeant, who had been celebrating his promotion with friends and cold beers, rose from a table to confront the lower-ranking man. The two began fighting. Mr. Mayes’s friend and others tried to break them up. Then, a gunshot rang out. A bullet struck the sergeant, James W. Emery, in his leg. Mr. Mayes was holding a pistol. He was swiftly arrested. He told investigators that he didn’t know whether he had pulled the trigger. But in 1956, he was dismissed from the service with a dishonorable discharge. “I wanted to remain in the Army,” he wrote in an affidavit in 2017, “but I was denied rehabilitation or restoration.” He made his way to Brooklyn, still carrying the stigma of his discharge. He said he had tried to commit suicide three times. “I struggled with depression, alcohol abuse and the shame of my dishonorable discharge,” he wrote. He eventually pulled himself up and started over, graduating from Adelphi University and going on to earn a master’s degree. “I found stability,” he wrote, “and dedicated my life to helping others.” He became a leader and an advocate in Brooklyn’s poorer neighborhoods, promoting mental health awareness and guiding those seeking help for drug addiction. He urged young men to register to vote and worked to raise awareness of H.I.V. prevention and treatment. He didn’t speak of his discharge from the Army, not even to his three daughters. His was one of some 260,000 so-called bad paper discharges of Korean War-era service members. They were handed down to black service members in disproportionate numbers, according to later government studies. Around 2014, with his health beginning to fail him, Mr. Mayes sought to petition the military to reconsider his discharge. The change was more than just words on paper: An upgrade in status would make him eligible to receive benefits available to veterans, including health care and burial in a military cemetery. “I feel that dedication to making positive changes in my own life empowered me to assist others in creating a successful life,” Mr. Mayes wrote. He worked with Steve Lessard, a lawyer and president of the New York County Lawyers Association, which takes on discharge upgrade cases free of charge; and Rob Cuthbert, a former coordinator for the Veteran Advocacy Project’s Discharge Upgrade Clinic. The request was denied. Mr. Mayes continued to decline. He lost his hearing and, in September, he stopped eating and was admitted to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. His team renewed their efforts, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York reached out to the acting secretary of the Army. The new appeal was a success. Sixty-three years after leaving the Army, Mr. Mayes’s discharge was upgraded from dishonorable to honorable. His daughter shouted the good news into his ear and showed him printed signs explaining what had happened. “We even played a recording” made by one of his advocates, Ms. Pilgrim said on Tuesday. “He would kind of follow us and look at us.” He was unable to speak but sometimes squeezed a hand on command, giving others hope that he understood the good news. His daughter likes to believe he knew. “He worked hard for all these years to prove his case,” she said. “He would have been ecstatic.” Plans were already underway to grant her father a wish he once feared was forever out of reach, one he pleaded in his own words in 2017: “To be buried in a national cemetery,” he wrote, “with my comrades-in-arms.”",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.114,0.759,0.127,0.9398

It’s a chance to honor his grandfather who served as a naval officer during World War II, and his cousin who still serves as a colonel. But, for the first time, that family celebration took place on Fifth Avenue, where Mr. Lotspeich, 52, and his family were among the thousands of spectators who gathered Sunday for New York’s annual Veterans Day Parade. “It’s important for people to appreciate the sacrifices of our veterans,” said Mr. Lotspeich, who was dressed in traditional Scottish garb to honor his family’s heritage. This year’s parade — stretching from 26th Street to 46th Street — featured thousands of participants, including members of local military schools, historical societies and active duty military members. Florent Groberg, who received the Medal of Honor for his services in Afghanistan, served as the Grand Marshal. Mr. Lotspeich, who lives in Glastonbury, Conn., applauded the public recognition of veterans, and said he hoped events like the parade would spark improvements to the treatment of veterans.“Our society likes to honor our veterans, but it typically does not follow through with taking care of them in terms of benefits,” he said. “Perhaps this will help build public support for stronger veterans programs and services.” This year’s parade also celebrated 100 years since the end of World War I, and many participants honored that history. “It’s just the icing on the cake,” Myra Carvalho, a Marine Corps veteran, said about the World War I centennial.",0.0,0.619,0.381,0.5719,0.043,0.704,0.253,0.9964
Veterans,NYT,2018,Suzanne Gordon,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/opinion/sunday/veterans-department-health-hospitals.html,"By Protecting Veterans’ Health, You May Protect Your Own","This Veterans Day, in addition to honoring those who serve in uniform, we should spend some time remembering the 300,000 employees of the Veterans Health Administration. The V.H.A. — the nation’s largest public health system — doesn’t just keep veterans healthy; it has developed treatments that help all Americans. And if we don’t defend it, it could be dismantled and auctioned off in whatever remains of the Trump era.In V.H.A. facilities I have met some of the best doctors, nurses, therapists and medical researchers I’ve encountered in 40 years of reporting on the hospital industry. They deliver high-quality care to more than nine million patients who are, on average, older, sicker and poorer than those served by other systems. Yet, unlike veterans themselves, who are praised by politicians and the press, V.H.A. staff members, and the agency they work for, are routinely denigrated. President Trump has insisted that “our veterans have been treated horribly” and that the V.H.A. is staffed with “bad apples” who “rob us or cheat us.” Last month, in a speech at a prestigious medical conference in Cleveland, John Boehner, the former House speaker, said the Department of Veterans Affairs, of which the V.H.A. is part, is simply “hopeless.” Its hospitals “provide substandard care to our veterans who deserve the best care,” Mr. Boehner said. “If you’re a real doctor, you’re probably not working at the V.A.” Studies have shown that private-sector doctors and hospitals are not prepared to deal with veterans’ complex needs. But foes of the V.H.A., backed by wealthy donors like the Koch brothers, want to dismantle its hospital and clinic network and contract out billions of dollars’ worth of veterans’ services to the private sector. In June, Congress passed the VA Mission Act, which expands veterans’ access to private care and establishes a commission to determine whether to close V.A. facilities. Its members will be appointed by the president, and they could include medical industry representatives who would benefit from privatization. Congress will be unable to vote on the commission’s decisions. The head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Robert Wilkie, perhaps influenced by a shadowy group of Trump associates nicknamed the Mar-a-Lago Crowd, is said to be developing rules that would significantly increase the number of veterans who get care outside the V.H.A. At the same time, private-sector care is more expensive, and the president and congressional Republicans refuse to allocate the money to pay for it, so each dollar that goes to it will come out of the V.H.A. budget. This will starve the system of needed resources, leave thousands of doctor and nurse vacancies unfilled, and force hospitals and clinics to shut down. The Koch brothers may be delighted by the prospect of a crippled system. Patients of the V.A.’s 11,000 physicians and other caregivers have a different view. The V.H.A. isn’t perfect; there have been some bad actors, and veterans often complain about having to wait for appointments. But while veterans’ organizations want better funding and staffing of the V.H.A., they overwhelming support its mission, for reasons outlined in “VA Healthcare: A System Worth Saving,” a report that I co-wrote for the American Legion last year. Dismantling the V.H.A. would jeopardize the health of its largely poor and working-class patients. It would also undermine the medical research and teaching that benefits all Americans. V.H.A. researchers have already given us the nicotine patch, the shingles vaccine, and innovative approaches to geriatric and end-of-life care. The administration is conducting a Million Veteran Program to determine how genes affect veterans’ health and ours. Because it treats so many patients with prostate cancer, it received a $50 million grant from the Prostate Cancer Foundation to discover new treatments for that disease. Insurgents’ use of improvised explosive devices in the Middle East has made the V.H.A. a leading center of research on and treatment of traumatic brain injuries (also suffered by professional football players, who now arrange to have their brains sent to the V.H.A. for post-mortem verification of their condition). The veterans’ system is also a leader in treating amputations and providing state-of-the-art prosthetics. By 2015, 1.6 million veterans were receiving specialized mental health treatment at the V.H.A., where thousands of mental health providers are taught the latest evidence-based treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other conditions. Seventy percent of all American doctors have received some training at V.A. hospitals. Many are taught about new treatments for the chronic pain from which so many veterans suffer, and how to reduce suicides. Suicide-prevention trainings are mandatory for all V.H.A. hospital employees — from a janitor to the chief medical officer — so they can recognize when someone is at risk. Many private doctors and hospitals seeking to care for veterans have less experience treating patients with these issues, and they also offer far less coordinated care. At a California V.H.A. residential program for brain-injured Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, for example, a psychologist and physical therapist work side by side to address their patients’ chronic pain and severe PTSD. This model both provides better care and keeps costs down by avoiding confusion and duplication. I am not a veteran, nor is anyone in my family. But this year, I’m observing Veterans Day by putting a bumper sticker on my car that says “Save Our VA!” The V.H.A.’s successes are the fruit of 100 years of federal expenditures. Let’s hope that a new Congress and, eventually, a different president, will find that investment worthy of protection before it’s too late.",0.0,0.755,0.245,0.3818,0.095,0.789,0.116,0.9362
